                    <p>Setting off on foot, from Exe Head Bridge, I stepped through the gate at Blackpitts and looking at the signpost, picked out the rough worn track in what I hoped would be the direction of Exe Head. To the side of me, where the bridge lay, the river was clearly evident, but as I followed the path higher up the side of the valley, it quickly became hidden amidst moorland low-lying canopy. The track snaked its way up the side of <b>Dure Down</b> and overlooked the valley of Exe Plain below. The track eventually merged with the more established Two Moors Way and led onto an area shown on the map as the site of Exe Head. This is the high ground made up of <b>The Chains</b> and its meeting with Dure Down. The surrounding land absorbs vast quantities of annual rain water and periodic melted snow. This water is then held between a solid floor of impervious bed rock and a huge layering mass of slowly rotting vegetation, formed over thousands of years, that lives above it. I rather like the description, the author, Henry Williamson gave to the soil “of the moor is its own dead and scanty “(6). In effect, the bog land is a natural reservoir, holding a deep reserve of water and gradually releasing this through innumerable springs across the moorland all year round. A land of bubbling streams as Alfred Tennyson put it. On the map, a ford was shown, but I confess, I could see no sign of anything approaching a ford, but then the ground was baked dry in the recent dry spell. In the vicinity of the gate, the earth was compacted by the spread of countless hooves and walkers’ boots. The first clue that I had reached my destination was a small sign set aside from a gate stating ‘<b>Exe Head</b>’. This marked the passing point to the track that leads onto <b>Hoar Oak Tree</b>, which has an interesting history. The original Hoar Oak Tree is thought to have been part of a line of trees marking the boundary of the old Exmoor Royal Forest. By 1658, it had become rotten and toppled over in a storm. A new oak was planted and this lasted until Boxing Day, 1916. To replace this, several saplings were placed in the vicinity and one survives in good order to this day.</p>
                    <p>To the side of the gate was a bank of earth covered in thick vegetation, which merged with the South Chains Wall, a little further up. My plan, was to follow the footpath in the direction of Pinkery Pond after I had done a little exploring of the source of the river. The bank was bounded on both sides by two lines of fences and out of this, a small trickle of water, fed into a small pool. The water was clear, its thin surface rippled in the breeze and stirred by the gentle flowing movement. Sediment of bright coloured stones was strewn around the floor of the pool, almost glistening in the strong sunlight. I listened for a while, closing my eyes at the same time, trying to concentrate fully on the mellifluous sound. The discordant tinkling and gurgling’s reverberations, whilst muted, produced an anarchic cacophony. However, the longer I listened, the more soporific and orchestral, it began to sound. On opening my eyes, I looked more intently at the juvenile ribbon of water steadily flowing from the pool. I watched as it rather sluggishly crossed the baked ground until it passed under a wire fence into the mass of vegetation covering Exe Plain. On the desk, I have the photos of my meeting with the source of the Exe. The photos show a tough flat terrain shouldered by a large blue sky and white billowy clouds. The horizon was unbroken by any tree or distinctive object, meaning there was a clear division between the land and the sky. At times, passing clouds suddenly cast enormous shadows over whole stretches of the landscape as if casting a bleak dark spell. The effect was just as instantaneously lifted with the return of full sunlight. It created a movement of constant drama and change of mood over the landscape. In the far distance, I could just make out the coastline of Porthcawl and the Glamorgan coast, appearing like some desert mirage in the shimmering heat. It was a reminder that the source of the river is just a few miles from the Bristol Channel.</p>

                    <p>Standing on a bank to take a photo of Exe Head, I remember thinking how inauspicious it all looked. I suppose, I had imagined there might be more to the source than was the case. There was no baptismal bathing spot, no commemorative stone or a sculpture. Instead, there was almost anonymity to the source, lost amidst the stark beauty of the moorland landscape and without any distinctive feature. However, the weather was benevolent, adding a warmth and vitality to a landscape that seemed a world away from that described as “filthy, barren ground” by the Author of “Robinson Crusoe", Daniel Defoe in 1724 during his tour of England and Wales (7). I simply marvelled, at the thought that from this tiny trail of water, a river rapidly grows by the time it runs underneath Exe Head Bridge, it resembles a river. Sitting down on the bank, I gathered my thoughts. Closing my eyes once more and lifting my head towards the sun, I enjoyed the sensation of the warm sunshine on my face. I listened more actively to the sound of the breeze rustling through the cotton grasses; the soothing sound of the water and occasional bird song. In the main, I was conscious of an overwhelming sense of being alone in this open moorland landscape and I found myself quite enjoying the experience.  I drew my trusty thermos from my rucksack and poured a cup of milky coffee and opened my copy of Rod Lawrence's book. Unlike me, he had elected to locate the source of the Exe by following the river upstream to where the tiny ribbon of water seemed to dissipate. Having reached this, he wrote that standing on this spot gave him a great sense of achievement. Sitting on my little bank of grass and gazing down towards this dry-baked pocket of Exmoor, I felt much the same way and aware too, that this was only the start of an adventure.</p>

                    <p>It also stirred a memory of the Victorian Adventure book, Lorna Doone, by R.D Blackmore. I well remember, a worn copy of the book being tucked away in one of the dusty book shelves of the Common Room, amongst a pile of other ancient looking tomes. I made some attempt to read it, but struggled with its dense wordiness and eventually gave up. However, help was later on hand, towards the end of my time with the choristers. I was given an impromptu guide around the Exeter Cathedral, by a venerable and rather eccentric Prebendary. He seemed, at the time, to be as old as the cathedral, itself and had clearly spent many years, looking at the memorials spread about the cathedral. He had made a careful study and I am grateful to him for two things. The first, was for showing me around the memorials where the stonemasons had made some mistake. I still look for them to this day. One depicted a kneeling figure with two left feet, whilst another figure had two left hands clasped tightly in prayer. There may have been more little errors, but I have forgotten them now. My second vote of thanks goes to his showing me the memorial to R.D. Blackmore on the interior of the West facing wall. Standing there, he instilled in me, some of the drama of the story to my formative imagination. I was reminded of this, by his account of John Ridd rescuing a little girl who had become trapped at the bog at the head of the Exe, whilst collecting whortleberries. It helped too, that for good effect, there featured a certain Mother Meldrum, The Witch of Exmoor, in the telling of this incident. "The child who would have died there, but for thy strength and courage, and most of all thy kindness. That was my grand-daughter, John; and all I have on earth to love"(8). Every time, I go to the Cathedral, I stop to look at the Blackmore memorial and fondly remember the Prebendary and his gift for story-telling.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img4} text={"Malmsmead. Lorna Doone Farm, October 2016"} />
                    <p>I have since remedied not having read the book, all those years ago. A copy was kindly given to me by my colleague, Chris, upon my retirement with the wise words, “use your time well “. This followed in the wake of several excursions to North Devon and Exmoor with him and a growing awareness, of how much of the area has become synonymous with the legacy of the book. On one fine October day, we explored the area known in recent years, as Doone Country; a nod to the popularity of the book and the importance of the literary tourism it has generated in the local economy. Our walk began at <b>Malmsmead</b>, whose ancient arching bridge and Lorna Doone Farm are prominent landmarks. Badgworthy Water flows under the bridge and over the ford that lies adjacent and beneath its steady flow. Standing at the northern end of Badgworthy Water, the river soon meets with Oare Water and from there, joins with East Lyn River and onto Lynmouth and the sea. In 1865, the author, <b>R.D Blackmore (1825-1900)</b>, lodged at The Rising Sun, in the fishing village of Lynmouth, to begin work on his classic novel. He was inspired to do so, through a long association with Exmoor in his youth. His Grandfather, John Blackmore, had been the Rector of St Mary's at Oare between 1809-1842 and the author had spent youthful holidays there. He was familiar with the stories of The Doones, a legendary gang of robbers and fugitives, who supposedly inhabited an enclave of the moors in the area and terrorised the local inhabitants and travellers. The actual location for their stronghold and the facts about the clan is shrouded in mystery and dispute, but has long been part of the local folklore and superstition and these most importantly would have been known to Blackmore. Indeed, he referred to these stories as “Nurses Tales “(9), but was nonetheless, inspired by these stories, to wander the surrounding valleys and moors close to Oare and there conjured up a store of adventures and imaginary locations that later found expression in his writing of the book (10). In later life, Blackmore returned to the memories of this landscape as the subject for his next novel, inspired in part, by his reading of serialised stories of Lorna Doone and The Doones in the magazine, Leisure Hour, which appeared in popular print in 1860. Whilst he stayed at The Rising Sun, he would make trips to the moors to conjure up the imagery and expression for his book. Walking through Badgworthy valley along the undulating footpath, I tried to discern some of the features of the landscape that found its way onto his pages. Our path took us to the site of the former medieval village, on the slopes of Hoccombe Coombe, a place Blackmore saw as the ruins of the Doones settlement. Following the footpath, we climbed up to the open moorland of Brendon Common. The sun bore down on us and I was glad, when we turned towards the descent into Lank Combe and the shadier regions of the oak woodlands. The slithers, a series of smooth rock formation over which a stream flows down the valley into Badgworthy Water, is reputed to have been the inspiration of the waterfall, described in the book. At the base of the valley, in a pool heavily shaded by a thick canopy of oak trees, Chris and I took a dip in the bitter cold black water. Relieved to have cooled ourselves from the heat generated with a walk on such a hot day, we dried in the sunshine and enjoyed our late lunch. Walking back to Lorna Doone Farm, we passed the granite memorial to Blackmore at the below Malmsmead Hill.</p>
                    <p>Blackmore also had had a strong affection for Devon forged, I suspect, from having been to Blundell’s School in Tiverton and spending time with his family at Kings Nympton, Ashford and Culmstock, where his Father held Curacies. He was clearly a bright student who gained scholarship to Oxford and attempted a legal career before ill-health prevailed. He was spared financial difficulties with a generous inheritance allowing him to try his hand at writing. Lorna Doone (not his first publication) proved something of a breakthrough in his writing career and become his bestselling work (11). It remains in print today and has featured in several films, plays and on television. My favourite interpretation is the 1951 Hollywood production with a distinct un-Exmoor-like landscape in the form of Californian orange glades and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Blackmore wove together a popular work of romance and adventure woven across the West Country and built around a fugitive from Sedgemoor after the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685.</p>
                    <p>Amongst his less well-known books, Blackmore's hinterland of imagination extended beyond Exmoor, to other parts of the South West with which he was familiar. ‘Christowell. A Dartmoor Tale “(1882) is a story woven around a solitary fictional character known to the villagers of <b>Christow</b> as Captain Larks. He lives in a cottage standing beneath a jagged tor some "five leagues off from the dark square towers of Exeter Cathedral”. The story reaches out beyond the Teign Valley towards Dartmoor and its stories and traditions. The loss of life at St Pancras, <b>Widecombe-in-the Moor</b> in October 1643 is referred to when a bolt of lightning struck. "Then fell the greatest crash of tempest ever known in England. The tower was cleft, the church was rent, the people cast, like blasted straws. The roof flew wide, the pillars snapped, the timber fell like cobwebs, and walls were riven as a bladder burst, and stifling vapour, shrouded all who were consumed”. The book also takes a glance towards <b>Mortenhampstead</b> on the eastern fringe of the moors with its former large elm standing by the village cross and known as the Dancing Tree. This was focus for the May Day Celebrations and held a platform raised in its tall bower for the young "lasses" to sit and watch events. Meanwhile, the young lads had to get up by means of a greasy short length of rope.</p>
                    <p>Whilst on the subject of Christow, it is recorded that during the threat of invasion by the French during the Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815) several wealthy families took up residence in the village rather than remain in their homes in Exeter, where the danger was felt to be greater met (12). I mention this, because he may well have had knowledge of this and indeed, the actual invasion by the French on the south Devon coastal town of Teignmouth, in July 1690. All this might have sowed the seeds for a subsequent book entitled Springhaven, which is commemorated on the cathedral memorial alongside Lorna Doone. Springhaven is a little fishing village in a tranquil Sussex valley "the place of all places in England for the French to land” and setting for an attempt by a covert French agent to forearm an invasion attempt.</p>
                    <p>His memory of the "spring bright “years spent in childhood at the foot of the Blackdown’s and the Culm Valley with its cluster of villages spread along the course The River Culm also provided the inspiration for one of his last publications; Perlycross. ‘A Tale of Western Hills’ (1894). It was at <b>Culmstock</b> that his Father, John had served as curate-in-charge and from the vicarage, that the author had made many a wandering along the Culm Valley, within the lie of three villages of Uffculme, Culmstock and Hemyock. He describes with great lyricism the landscape he recalled. An example is to a desolate area he called Blackmarsh, near Dunkeswell;</p>
                    <p>"A long way back down among the Blackdown hills, and in nobody knows what parish, the land breaks off into a barren stretch, uncouth, dark, and desolate. Being neither hill nor valley, slope nor plain, morass nor woodland, it has no lesson for the wanderer, except that the sooner he gets out of it the better. For it is a lonesome and gruesome place, where weather makes no difference; where Nature has not put her hand, on this part or that, to leave a mark or show of preference, but slurred the whole with one black frown of desolate monotony”. The plot hinges on the disappearance of Sir Thomas Waldron from a vault beneath the church and false accusation of body-snatching against the local doctor.</p>
                    <p>All this I gathered, in the thought that Blackmore is best known for Lorna Doone, whereas he is less associated (if at all) with the Blackdown Hills, other than in an autobiographical sense and is perhaps an opportunity awaiting to happen. This might come in the suggestion, that Simonsbath; high on Exmoor (and somewhere we pass through in the book) may have gained the 'Simons' part of its place name, from the legend of Simon the hunter, who had a stronghold in Symonsburrow, the highest point of the Blackdown Hills. He apparently used to bathe in the Barle, just upstream from the bridge at Simonsbath for reasons that are completely lost on me, although, if you had to pick a nice river in which to do your ablution, the Barle is a good choice. Speaking of which, I had travelled up from Exeter, in part to have a swim in the Barle, although more specifically Pinkery Pond. However, I didn't go, instead, choosing to lay back on the little island of grass and close my eyes. I didn't sleep. I just listened and felt the breeze mingling with the warm sunshine and cannot remember a time better spent.</p>

                    <p>Alas, even the best lingering moments have their allotted time and stirring myself out of a trance like stupor, I decided it was time to be going homeward. It was also an opportunity to pay my respects to South Molton and on my way there, call into the hamlet of <b>Charles</b>, a place familiar to R.D Blackmore. It is a delightful place to visit, as I discovered, having coaxed my old Citroen up the steep winding Grass Park Lane to verge close to the Parish Church of <b>St John the Baptist</b>. Blackmore stayed with his Uncle, Richard John Blackmore, who was at one time, the incumbent Rector. It was Richard, rather than his older Brother, John, who secured by inheritance, the position, procured originally by his Father, John, some fifty years earlier. At the time of its purchase, there was a sitting incumbent who remained in post until the Brother's Father was too old to fill it. Having taken up the post, Richard played host to his nephew and family over the years that followed. Arriving in the village, I found the place quiet and seemingly deserted. A slight breeze whistled through the churchyard and birdsong reverberated in the warm afternoon sunshine. I could quite see how Blackmore wrote; “as a boy amidst the scenes and silences of a place as remote from the highways of men as any in the whole of England at the time “(11). It was at the Rectory that Blackmore also wrote much of Lorna Doone. I had the good fortune to meet one of the villagers, Ros who lived nearby to the church and offered to show me around and I gladly took her up on this. She directed me to the gravestone of William Buckingham who had been "in the constant employ" of the Reverend J.P Blackmore (the author's Paternal Grandfather) and whom, had met an untimely and instantaneous death following a fall from a horse and cart. He was aged just 34-years at the time of his unfortunate accident in October 1829. His Wife, Susan was subsequently commemorated on the same gravestone. It is perhaps, fitting that the centenary of his birth on the 7th June 1925, saw a commemorative stained-glass window be placed on the east side of the parish church of Charles in his honour. <b>The Reverend Walter William Joyce (1867-1945)</b> was instrumental in raising money for the window. It appears, Joyce shared a similar passion to Blackmore, for the moors, having had his own book, “Echoes of Exmoor “, published in the same year. The Reverend Joyce took on the incumbency in 1916 and served the parish until his death in September 1945. I noticed in the chancel, a memorial to his service to the community. He is certainly remembered in the hamlet as cutting a striking “High Church “figure, wearing a sweeping black coat and clerical hat and zipping about in a powerful open top motorcar. He also wrote a couple of books; Echoes of Exmoor and Moorside tales and talks. It was through his fund-raising efforts that the Blackmore Memorial Window was installed. I was also told that, he was a relative of William Joyce, otherwise known as the infamous Nazi broadcaster, Lord Haw Haw, but I haven't been able to confirm this. At the time of his death, he and his Wife, Mary had lived for 29-years at St. Petroc’s Rectory. It stands a little back from the narrow, high Devon banks of Huddley Mill Lane, that follows the western slope of the hamlet down to Charles Bottom. In appearance, the house looks more like a miniature castle, which seems slightly out of keeping with its original purpose to provide a Rectory. It was built on the site of the former chapel in 1824. A tall gate screened the drive to the house, but I could make out the domed roof that sits on one side of the house, offering quite a feature for one of the living rooms. The author, Blackmore recalled it; „where the lawn is a russet sponge of moss and a stream trickles under the dining room floor “. I continued my way own to Charles Bottom and came across the old granite bridge, close to Hundley Mill, that Blackmore recorded sitting on a large fallen menhir and composing his early works. I sat on the side of the bridge for a time, hoping for some similar inspiration. I could alas, see no menhir and contented myself with the more elemental enjoyment of the sight and sound of the babbling stream, passing quickly underneath on its way down to The River Bray.</p>

                    <p>South Molton is always a pleasure to wander around. My Father was Head Teacher at the Secondary Modern School in the early 1980's and where my parents and youngest Sister, Lizzie, rented a house nearby. It's not a so much a home-coming as a return to the fleeting memories I have of the fish and chip shop in South Street and a few walks into the town centre from my parents’ house on the edge of the town. Like anyone in their early twenties, I was too caught up in my own life to have much appreciation for the charms of a North Devon town that seemed dull and uninspiring at the time. Whereas now, with a wholly different perspective, I can only regret that I did not see the opportunities available to me at the time to record the earlier character of the town. I have come to some appreciation of this through Lizzie, for retrospectively opening my eyes to the value of the place. Lizzie remembered a time when a bull escaped from one of the cattle compounds behind The Pannier Market and ran amok. She retains a keen childhood memory of the rural nature of the town and the characters she met, both here and later at <b>Crockernwell</b>, some 30 miles away on the eastern fringe of Dartmoor. It was here that she and our Parents lived, whilst our Father secured his last Headship at <b>Cheriton Bishop</b> Primary School. In later life, she worked for South West Water and spent considerable time driving around much of rural Devon to investigate customer’s complaints. In the process, she came across many interesting characters and places that have coalesced with my interest in the photographic work of James Ravilious and an innate general interest in social history. I thank her through these pages for this gift. </p>

                    <p>So, in this semi-nostalgic frame of mind, I stood by the arching frontage of the Guildhall (1740's) taking in the passing of people scurrying along Broad Street. The town had the appearance of winding up for the day. I tried not to take it too personally. Alas, the marvellous museum tucked away at the entrance to the town hall was closed. However, the <b>Pannier Market</b> was still open, although now half empty with traders beginning to pack up their stalls for the day. This didn't stop me from enjoying the spectacle of the cavernous nature of the hall. In fact, the slow running down of the day's commercial business, lended more attention to the study of the hall itself. The strongest impression was that the hall would have been a major improvement to the commercial life of the town, providing a covered area to cope with the vagaries of the North Devon weather. The continuity of the market harks back to the ancient customs and traditions in the commercial life of the old town. It remains in the centre of the town and in the essentials, largely unchanged. It has retained its character and sense of occasion. To give some emphasis to this, hanging down from the high ceiling were colourful banners displaying the communal life and diversity of the town. On the surrounding walls were regulation signs, but mixed in with this, were murals bearing witness to vibrant history of the town. My interest, however, was drawn to the floor of the hall where the real drama takes place. On busy days, the stalls are tantalizingly bedecked with all manner of goods and is where the eyes of Visitors are turned. Over these stalls the business of the day is conducted. There is a well-established hierarchy of stalls. Regular stall-holders have their established or favoured pitches, whereas, the novice or infrequent trader finds a pitch on the less desirable spots. Each stall has its own character, shaped as much by the personality of the seller, as the wares or produce they have on display. In days gone by, they were brought and displayed in a large assortment of baskets, whereas now they are boxed up and put in vans parked at the rear of the hall. What I most value, is the human element. As a connoisseur of People-Watching, (or someone who is apt to stare, as Kathy more perceptively reminds me) there is nothing to compete with the spectacle of the market. I attempt to overhear, the haggling exchanges between potential customers and the sellers. I observe with some amusement the etiquette of manoeuvring around fellow shoppers or browsers.  There is a palpable sense of noisy, restless energy of being in the company of others. The hall makes for a lively, invigorating and theatrical experience and I hope survives the increasing use of the Internet in our more detached shopping behaviour. The advent of the railway did much to bring about a steep decline in the Woollen and Coaching trade that were a major feature of the town right up until the mid 19c. The population declined and the economy of the town suffered, but the market has survived and from the range of stalls still on show, it appears there is still much life in the old hall yet.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img7} text={"South Molton"} />
                    <p>Stepping out of the market and crossing The Square, I made my way to Church Street. On the wall above one of the cottages was a figure of a black cat climbing up the wall. I thought this was rather amusing and I am glad I spotted it. I entered the churchyard of <b>St Mary Magdalene</b>. The paths at the front of the church are lower than the raised banks of the churchyard, offering an interesting perspective on the gravestones gathered around its approach. In spring and summer, it must be nice to see the flowers at closer proximity, softening the character of this stony kingdom of memorial. As always, I ponder at the names commemorated on some of the stones. The sense of connection between the living and the dead is much looser today, whereas, in former times, these churchyards were a more regular reminder. The remembrance evoked by each gravestone is measured by the passage of time, the weathering on their inscriptions and the changing nature of the town. I am reminded often reminded of the ethereal vivid quality conveyed in Sir Stanley Spencer's painting, The Resurrection (1924-7). In the front churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, the deceased villagers of Cookham emerge from their graves. It might appear as a modern-day horror film, but this is to misunderstand its meaning. Stanley Spencer had a deep attachment to the Thames -side village of his birth, (“a village in heaven “) and where he lived for much of his life and is buried in the churchyard. The painting reflects his religious convictions and his knowledge of some of the deceased, either through their family names or through his own acquaintanceship. I suspect this is much less common today. There was certainly a contrast with the shadier side at the rear of the church. Here, tombstones are laid flat against the ground, creating a phalanx effect with the names of the devoted and their testimony borne towards the skies. This felt more like the land of stone. There was a mood of other-worldliness, reinforced in my imagination when I realised, I was being closely watched by a black cat peeking from discreet corners of the churchyard. Inside the church, I sat for a short time and took in the view. It is a fine sturdy looking building, both inside and out. How, I should judge its supposed rival church, St Hieritha, in <b>Chittlehampton</b>, I do not know. On my last occasion, visiting St Hieritha, aside from joining the choir in their practice, I hear the story of the two brothers who competed to design and build the most beautiful church. One was responsible for Mary Magdalene in South Molton and the other, St Hieritha at Chittlehampton. Part of the condition was that each would not inspect the other's work and progress until they were complete. When the buildings were complete, both brothers met to consider each-other's work. They agreed that Chittlehampton, "Cathedral of North Devon", St Hieritha was the best. The story has the sad ending with the suicide of the brother who lost.</p>

                    <p>Leaving the church, I made my way down to Broad Street by way of the small avenue of lime trees and past Mr Brown's Vault 1827. The centre of the town has a distinctive character with two islands and some impressive looking buildings facing the square. Those that have retained their original names and purpose, I particularly, liked; the iron railing Medical Hall and General Post Office. Everywhere, I looked there was bunting displayed along the lime trees and guerrilla knitting festooned over tree trunks to adorn the forthcoming South Molton Carnival. The bust of Hugh Squier set into the Guildhall looks down on approvingly. By now, the day was drawing in and I was keen to look at the outside of the Baptist Church. Years ago, on a bimble around the town, I had turned into New Road and came across the church and stopping, had noticed the memorial set into the side of the building in memory of “Sarah, Wife of James Badcock. Who died of a seizure, June 15th 1853, aged 52 years “. It carried the epitaph, which must still move the hardest of souls: “Farewell my Husband and children, whom I love most dear. It is a sudden change! I had no time to wish you well. Before Christ fold me in his arms “. Whether, these were the words of a grieving family or perhaps the final elegant flurry of Thomas, the engraver, I do not know. It's interesting what sticks in your mind.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>The following year, I went to <b>Pinkery Pond</b> or <b>Pinkworthy</b> as it has otherwise, previously been called. It lies on the western edge of Challacombe Common and on the Southern end of The Chains, which comes from the Devonshire pronunciation of Chine meaning backbone. Passing Simonsbath, I followed the Challacombe road towards <b>Goat Hill Bridge</b> which is where I planned to park and make the trek up to the Pond. As the windscreen wipers were fully occupied, I did wonder, if the swim at the pond was going to be viable. However, as if on cue, on reaching the lay-by close to the bridge, the rain had made itself scarce. So, gathering my rucksack over my shoulders and my trusty and much abused camera, I began the walk up to the pond along the track leading past <b>The Pinkery Farm Exploration Centre</b> and then picking up the pitted footpath towards the pond. The first hint that I was reaching my destination came with the looming man-made ridge that effectively forms the dam. As I began to walk up the ridge, the sound of rushing water became more noticeable and soon I could see the rushing flow of water emanating from a spillway to the side of the dam. The spillway maintains a steady flow of water into what makes up the fledgling River Barle, as it starts on its journey towards the Exe. Rising up from the footpath you reach a wooden gate on top of the ridge and here you get the first view of the pond. I am not sure if someone was having some fun, when they called it a pond. Covering an area of seven acres and dropping down to 30 feet, it seems to qualify as more of a small lake. It looks unremarkable and rather plain but that is to ignore its history. Its open feature also reflects the mood of the weather, as I recall now with two other occasions, I have stood on the same promontory overlooking the pond below. On both these occasions, the pond had looked wild, exposed and inhospitable in the cold stormy conditions. However, on this day, the sun had put up a fine show with the departure of the earlier rain. There was now a sharp clarity with brilliant sunlight emerging periodically from behind the clouds. The light seemed to infiltrate every crease and crevice in the folds of the moorland and cast some invisible warmth on the surface of the water. Such conditions made the prospects for swimming altogether more inviting. It should be said, that I am not averse to swimming in the rain, but I do like to be assured that afterwards, I can dry off and change into soggy free clothing. This leads me onto a process of weighing up the necessary conditions for a swim. I will let you have the method for free. You just have to think NUTS and use each letter to decide if the conditions are favourable or not.</p>
                    <Divider horizontal>One</Divider>
                    <p>Starting with the letter 'N' you assess the <u>Natural</u> conditions you face. This includes, how the weather is behaving, windy, cold or hot and how safe the water seems. On this front, everything seemed satisfactory. It was dry, reasonably warm. There was a thin stretch of open space by the side of the pond, offering some shelter and a convenient place to change.</p>
                    <Divider horizontal>Two</Divider>
                    <p>The letter 'U' stands for <u>Uninviting</u>. Whatever, the romance of Wild Swimming (admittedly this is my description, a view not widely shared) there are times, when a potential swimming opportunity doesn't seem that inviting. It could be for good sound reasons or perhaps, just on the whim and vagaries of the day. No such complaint however, could be made to the welcome sight before me. The open water surrounded by beautiful moorland and lit beneath bright sunshine seemed eminently inviting.</p>
                    <Divider horizontal>Three</Divider>
                    <p>The 'T' is for <u>Towel</u> or something similar. This can make or break a spontaneous swim, because whilst getting in can prove simple enough, getting dry (and getting warm in very cold conditions) is tricky with a pair of socks. So, it helps if you are forearmed with a nice big blue wrap around towel.</p>
                    <Divider horizontal>Four</Divider>
                    <p>This leaves the letter 'S' which stands for <u>Spirit</u>. Your frame of mind when you are deciding to take the plunge or not. Sometimes, this extends to the company of others, who are willing or not to take to the waters. On this memorable day, the spirit of Wild Swimming was firmly assured. Having quickly weighed things up, I knew I was definitely confident of being NUTS.</p>
                    <p>Having changed into my bathing shorts, I began to wade slowly into the cool peaty waters and knelt down to absorb the temperature, before gently launching myself into the water. Just at that moment, the sunlight was impeded by passing clouds and the water appeared grey and uninviting. A sudden breeze blew ripples across the water. The effect was to create a malign swarm, spreading across the surface of the pond. This put me in mind of the Author, Henry Williamson, writing of his experience of bathing in the pond; "monsters are lurking down there. You can't enjoy a solitary swim” (7). It was also where he wrote about <b>Tarka the Otter</b> taking refuge in the "deep and brown and still, reflecting rushes and reeds at its sides, the sedges on the hills and the sky over them”. I became suddenly aware, that I could no longer feel the floor of the pond and was relying on myself completely to swim or sink. In freshwater, there is less buoyancy than in the sea but any disquiet, swiftly dissipated, as I made strong strokes towards the Western side of the pond. On reaching the side, my feet were able to find a shelf upon which I could stand. I looked back across the stretch of water, I had crossed. In this solitary space, with my worldly goods contained in my rucksack and towel, on the other side of the pond, I felt both liberated and exposed. There was a pleasant sense of freedom and feeling unencumbered; of moving freely and fully engaged in the physical environment. However, the sudden nature in which the pool had become deep had also unnerved me. I was alone and although I didn't feel tired, I was aware, that the water was cooling my body temperature and I needed to make a decision whether to swim back or get out and walk along the bank. It was the welcome sunlight that revived my spirits. The immediate casting of a delightful shimmering effect on the surface of the water had an almost miraculous effect.  I felt drawn and mesmerised by this natural light show as I made my way back across the water.</p>
                    <p>Having dried myself and dressed, I walked up to the grassy bank that forms the dam and walked along it until I found a nice place to sit. Having poured myself a cup of milky coffee, I surveyed the pond with the air of someone, who has developed some intimacy with it. I should be grateful to John Knight and the 200 County Mayo Navies; he employed to construct the reservoir back in 1830. I am pretty certain John Knight didn't have me in mind when he commissioned work on the Pond, but then it isn't entirely clear why he had it built in the first place. Whilst its specific purpose isn't clear, it seems to have been part of a wider plan to develop his considerable estate in the area. Although, I didn't visit the site, I have read that the embryonic beginnings of a canal were cut nearby, although this project was never completed. The author S.H. Burton (13) doubts this was the purpose, stating that the lake would have been inadequate to have floated more than a toy boat down to Simonsbath. However, the pond along with other works he had done to his estate remains and we will return to him in the next chapter.</p>
                    <p>On a sadder note, was the attempt to find the body of Richard Gammon, a local Farmer well respected in the area and left a widower with ten children in his care. His clothes were found by the side of the pond and in one of the jacket pockets, a letter found, from a young woman of neighbouring Parracombe, turning him down for his declarations of love for her. A search of the pond proved difficult and the Lynmouth Lifeboat Service loaned a small rowing boat and a diver to help scour the pond. However, when this proved unsuccessful, it was decided to drain the pond, a task not made easier, by the difficulty in dislodging the two wooden plugs at the base of the dam. However, the problem of drainage was overcome and on the morning of March 28th, 1889 at 06:15am, the body of Mr Gammon was found on the ledge of rock on the western side of the pond and estimated to have been some eight feet under the water. He was reckoned to have been there for 15-days. The case of another suspected case of suicide in 1912, led to the draining of the pond, only this time no body was found. The search was for Mr William Stenner, a married man with six children, who lived in Riscombe, near Exford. On the 9th August, he had gone to bed early, but the following morning his wife couldn't find him and before long a big search was underway. Despite Pinkery Pond being some distance, it was decided to dredge the pond, but when this proved fruitless, it was decided to drain the pond. However, removing the plug at the base of the dam proved very difficult, but this was eventually overcome and the pond drained only to reveal no body. Spectators came in their droves to witness the event. Then in late February: some seven months after his reported missing, the body of William Stenner was found close to his cottage wedged in a flooded passage to an abandoned mine (14). I discovered from Eric Delderfield's book, Exmoor Wanderings of one further draining of the pond that took place in 1947, as part of a search for a man, who was believed to have committed suicide. Once again, no body was found, but before the pond was refilled "the local carpenter carved the dates on two wooden plugs which seal the draining vents, so that the date of the last draining will be known"(15). </p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img9} text={"Exmoor"} />
                    <p>From my vantage point, I called to mind a much earlier impression of the pond from my copy of Henry Williamson's book; Tarka the Otter. Mine is a later edition, but the first edition books were published in 1927 and contained wood etchings by Hester Sainsbury. The success of the book led to what would be the first of a number of reprints. The reprint in 1933, featured the work of <b>Charles Frederick Tunnicliffe (1901-1979)</b> and it is to his illustration of Pinkworthy Pond that I was drawn. With encouragement from his wife, Tunnicliffe contacted Williamson's publishers, Putnam's and Sons, sending them samples of his work in the hope of securing a commission. A letter from the publishers to Williamson forwarded the “out of the blue “samples for his consideration. It also made the suggestion that Williamson might take photographs of the area in early spring, fall of snow or heavy frost. The letter ended with a suggestion: “I suppose you would not care to consider pencil sketches by Lionel Edwards. I learn he may be available “. In the event, Williamson very much liked Tunnicliffe's work and invited him to come and stay with him at his home, “Shallowford “in the North Devon village of Georgeham, where he had lived since 1921. The month of May 1932, must have been a good month. Over the course of a few days, the pair travelled around the map of the trail led by Tarka and provided Tunnicliffe with the imagery he needed to begin his commission (16). Tunnicliffe's illustration of Tarka standing alert on the bank of the dam, surrounded by sedge, shows him looking across Pinkery Pond, its surface water tensed with ripples to the side and in the middle, an undisturbed calm reflecting the sky above. I sat with just this same view in more-or-less, the same location. Tarka is shown looking in the direction of the horizon with billowy clouds. Silhouetted against this background is a stag racing across the open moorland. Out of view, is the hunt that is chasing the stag and perhaps, the same hunting party from which Tarka earlier escaped at Junction Pool, a little further south of South Molton at the meeting of the rivers, Mole and Taw. Whilst recuperating around the pond, Tarka would emerge from his “rillet's bed, scarcely wider than himself and looked through green harts-tongue ferns at the combe up which he had travelled “. It was a landscape, Henry Williamson knew not only so well from his solitary rambles over the south west part of the moors, but also expressed poetically in his writing. This was the starting point of my odyssey “where sedge grasses grow on the slopes to the sky “(6). The success of Tarka the Otter, had amongst other tributes, awarded him the Hawthornden Prize in 1928, with the princely sum of £100. Williamson put this money to good use. At the top of Ox Cross, overlooking the village of Georgeham, he had a wooden writing shed built of oak and elm. Around the shed, he planted a boundary of Monterey pine. From his lofty perch, he continued to write prodigiously, often spending up to 15-hours a day in isolation, surrounded by his simple table and chair, gramophone player and records and nearby his brick fireplace. Tunnicliffe continued with his illustrations, collaborating in the late 1950's and early 1960's with the Ladybird editions of what to look for in the seasons.</p>
                    <p>It was time for me to go, just as Tarka had to leave his sanctuary. My route was southwards, whereas, Tarka “journeyed over the chains to water that hastened in a bright thread out of the bog “. Upon reaching Hoar Oak, “a sapling caged from the teeth and horns of deer, a little tree by the grave of his father “, he picked up the scent of the trail of the otters. Nothing so poetic for me, alas, but just as I was making ready to return to the car, I noticed a couple make their way down to the pond. Within no time at all, the woman was swimming towards the centre of the pool, whilst her companion, made his way up the bank and settled down to watch her. I felt a kindred spirit with this woman, as she swam gracefully through rippling surface of the water. I wondered if she had spontaneously had decided on making the swim or had come with the intention of doing so. As I made my way back along the ridge in the direction of the gate, I acknowledged the man below and remember his telling me that he hadn't felt brave enough to go in himself. His chosen decision-making system is one I am very often presented with, when suggesting to friends and loved ones, that a swim would be nice. It is the more commonly used decision-making system, universally known as NFWAIGIT, an acronym for "No way am I going in there". I forget what the 'F' stands for?</p>
