                <Header as="h1">Exe Head Bridge.</Header>
                <p>A few years ago, on a hot Summer's day, I was kayaking with my friend, Chris, on a glass still sea. Having launched from the pebbly cove at Ladram Bay, off the East Devon coastline, we were making our way towards the seaside town of Budleigh Salterton. Leaving behind, the cove at Ladram behind, we passed the headland at Smallstones Point and followed the spectacle of the orange-red sandstone cliffs rising high above us in the piecing blue sky on our way towards Otterton Ledge. Somewhere between these two points, I recall we were greeted by a fellow traveller with the words, "days like this don't grow on trees" and this has stayed in my memory ever since. Such words readily sprang to mind with the day, Charles and I had chosen for the second leg of our journey. Having met at <b>Exford</b> public car park, which was to be our destination for this leg of the walk, we used my car to drive to <b>Exe Head Bridge</b>. This, you will recall, marked the place where the first part of the Exe Walk had concluded, before we made our way back to our starting point at Goat's Head Bridge.</p>
                <Header as="h1">Prayway Meads.</Header>
                <Image src={img3} fluid rounded />
                <br />
                <p>Collecting the stone hidden just below Exe Head Bridge, we attempted to walk as close to the river as possible, but as we entered the valley of <b>Prayway Meads</b> and the rough boggy terrain, it proved no easy task. The ground was heavily saturated and each footstep, no matter how carefully taken could soon land us in a sucking pool of cold water. My walking boots and socks hastily assumed a squelching sound with each footstep, as they filled with water. This only added to the increasing discomfort of trying to stay upright and mobile. The tough grasses and tussocks also acted as obstacles, requiring close attention. They became like miniature island stepping stones, without the surety of any foothold. Each required balance and poise (in very short supply my end) and an even higher degree of luck. Our attempts to find easier passage on the higher sides of the valley did not profit us much. We wrestled equally there with finding solid footholds in the sodden and uneven landscape. By now, the river had taken on the character of a brook, but it was still possible to step or jump across in places. This allowed us to find, in short intervals, a passage along the side of the brook, where the vegetation was less dense. This also offered the welcome sight of the water pouring through the mini channels, between peaty banks or exposed rocks, cascading into little pools of water. All the while, there was the constant watery cacophony of rushing, gurgling noise, which I rather enjoyed. The heat of the warming sunshine was adding another layer of discomfort and I had by now, removed my coat and fleece and was in need of cooling down. It marked the one time, where I vividly recall questioning if the venture was beyond me. The fact that so short a time into the walk had left me feeling pretty exhausted, raised the further question as to whether I might become something of a hindrance. As we scrambled about the watercourse, I kept for now these thoughts to myself. To his credit and perhaps intuitive concern for others, Charles had not left me trailing behind, but whilst having his own struggles was reassuringly keeping an eye out for me. Most helpfully, he was also looking for a potential place to stop. By the time I joined him by the side of a pool, I had already near drained one of my two water canisters. Knowing it was important to replenish my supply, I decided that here, the water might at least be relatively clear to drink. I held the cannister down in the stream and in seconds it was full and tentatively took a sip. The water was cold, its taste and smell peaty but it was refreshing and slated my thirst. Closing the canister and putting it to one side, I drew water up with the cup of my hands to wash my face and neck and taste a little more of the water before the rest stop was over. The moment of my unspoken crisis was for now temporarily forestalled and I allowed myself the opportunity to lift my head upward to scan the view. This was something more difficult when negotiating the immediate tough terrain below me.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Moorland attracts many supposedly negative descriptions about barrenness and featurelessness. That hasn't been my experience of Dartmoor with its generous outcrop of individually shaped tors and the remnants of history scattered about its landscape. The same, I could suggest about the barrows and monuments around Exmoor in terms of its history, but is to the combes, that I have found most inviting. They act as an escape from the more exposed parts of the high moor and offer sanctuary and more intimate sense of scale. What heightens their appeal is the contrast between the broader canvas of the moorland and the more enclosed sheltered setting they provide within their folds. Walking low in Cleave valley, one side was partially kept in shadows, especially in the deeper enclaves. Looking up, I had to squint my eyes to look up at the steep rise of the valley, towards the rocky outcrop known as the Raven's Nest. Perhaps, it was to this potential nesting site, that the hen raven returned after Tarka the otter had watched her catch tiny bullfrogs by the side of Pinkery Pond (6). Sunshine poured down over the slopes like a waterfall of light, creating a dramatic contrast between the world of shadows and that of light. The grassy tussocks with bleached appearance in the bright sunshine, presented a searing desert colour, but, in the shadows, the folds and surfaces appeared more brooding and arctic. Occasionally, beheld the presence of a solitary Rowan or Hawthorn tree amidst the vast space, standing forlornly like lonely sentinels. As we circumnavigated the valley, we approached the remains of an old stone wall, lined of wind worn Beeches. Their time fashioned trunks and bare winter prickly branches were contorted with an appearance not unlike the magical drawings of Arthur Rackman. We stepped gingerly over the rampart and from here, the walking became easier as we picked up what seemed like a crude sheep-worn track. At one point, we came across a line of withered looking Hawthorn trees, their emaciated form sharply accentuated in the bright blue sky. I did wonder if this this part of the walk followed the preparations made for a planned railway line in the valley. During the 1850's-1860's, Frederic Knight actively sought to establish viable iron mines around the southern part of the estate, including Cornham and along the Barle. There was only ever partial success at this, but sufficient hope (at least on Knight's part) to commission between 1856-7, a survey and then preparations for a light railway between Simonsbath and Porlock Weir. The plan had been for iron ore once extracted, to be taken in trucks pulled by locomotive engine, from Simonsbath towards Warren Farm and onto Whit Stones by means of long curving inclines to manage the gradient up Porlock Hill. For the steep descent, rope worked inclines would take the trucks down to the dockside, pulling the return empty trunks back up the hill. From there, the returning empties would roll into Prayway Mead crossing near Exe Head and proceed by sweeping curve over Duredown and down to the Barle (13). The scheme foundered at the point where the delivery of railway lines was anticipated. A supporting company pulled out of the enterprise, fearing it lacked financial viability and the scheme was abandoned.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Into view, came the sight of Warren Bridge. It felt as if the moorland was in retreat as we stepped onto the small track that took us along the bridge. Standing in the middle of the bridge, I noticed the layers of thickly gorged watery sphagnum moss adorning its half conical crested stones that top its sides. In such a stark environment, I rather admired the artistic fashioning of the topping, which made the bridge a little decorous. A substantial bridge too, standing in a small wooded valley of beeches and low lying sallow offering a confined sheltered space. Everywhere, you can sense the high moisture content in the air. The earlier high-pitched tinkling sound of the stream has given way to a more reverberating cacophony. The river, fed by countless springs and streams, had gained force and momentum. In doing so, the water is perennially shaping an ever-changing landscape with the erosion of banks and stones that stand in its downward path. The uplift of water vapour formed layers of moisture on every surface. Nowhere was this more visible, than on the wet stones and vegetation, cloaked in its thin moisture coating and producing a briny scent. The sheltered conditions combined with the cooling water meant the temperature was noticeably chillier, than that experienced on the open mid-day moorland. In this crowded watery enclave, the wetness finds ally with the plants and surfaces that both play host, as well as depend upon its bounty. Perhaps the most identifiable signifier of this were the carpets of mosses, acting as mini reservoirs, soaking up stores of water droplets within its porous substance. On gently pressing with my hands, I felt a pleasant almost weightless resistance. This was followed with the slow release of water beneath the palms of my hand and trickling down my arms and fingers. Releasing my hands from the sponge, it quickly re-asserted itself in its original fulsome form over the imprint of my hands. I took some simple pleasure in the gentle communing with this life-form with the knowledge that I had not damaged or defiled it. Moss of this depth and hold takes considerable time to establish itself. It is not only an important part in the habitat of the area, but to my mind, softens the hardest of landscapes. Its rich cloak of greens and browns over the bridge gave it a venerable appearance fitting. with its age. The bridge continues to serve as the crossing of the Exe for <b>Warren House Farm</b>, another legacy of The Knight Estate. Built in 1850, the farmhouse stands in splendid isolation, sided by the steepness of the valley sides and the open moorland beyond. In former days it's cottages and 500 acres offered a living for up to six labourers, as well as a shepherd and his wife. Today the farm offers bed and breakfast alongside continuing the tradition of rearing of cattle.</p>

                <Header as="h1">The Exmoor Forest Inn.</Header>
                <p>There is a footpath from the bridge, that leads up to <b>Clovenrocks Bridge</b> and joins the original road towards Simonsbath. From here, the road leads down to the hamlet, passing St Luke's on the right and towards <b>The Exmoor Forest Inn</b>. This has an interesting association with Frederic Knight, who disapproved of the inn selling beer as it caused fights and disrupted work among his workforce. However, he allowed for the sale of wine, which I assume was more expensive and therefore less likely to cause intoxication (15). In time, it followed in the path of the Temperance Movement, before re-licensing itself as a pub, which it remains to the present day. It too, has the story of Highwayman, Tom Faggus, a character who crops up on several occasions, not least in Lorna Doone. On this occasion, he very nearly came a cropper to a waiting band of sworn deputies disguised as customers in the bar. As soon as they made their intentions known, Faggus whistled to his horse Winnie, who came in fine style to his aid by crashing through the window and with Faggus firmly on her back, the daring duo make good their escape. </p>
                <Header as="h1">Sam and his Devon Spade.</Header>
                <Image src={img7} fluid rounded />
                <br />
                <p>For our part, Charles and I made our way from Warren Bridge along the original track that skirts the river before making its steep ascent. Not far from the top and before it reached the Simonsbath road, we negotiated a crossing over to the fields behind <b>Honeymead Farm</b>. To the side of the track and close to where some infilling work had been taking place, was a magnificent long handled spade. It was something I dearly coveted as I watched an old neighbour effortlessly cut into his hard-baked soil in his allotment on one of the foothills of Haldon Hill. "You won't be beaten with this" Sam used to say, as his large hands gripped the handle and he plunged the long-pointed blade into the ground as if it were butter. A short but sturdy man, when holding the spade upright it dwarfed him by some measure. However, his service as a stoker in the Navy during The Second World War had served him well. In much the same profession, he ensured that the boilers were fed and kept burning at Exminister Hospital. He had acquired mastery of the art of shovelling. I recall my lamentable attempts. Sam did his best to instruct me. Using my left hand around the lower reach of the handle to guide the blade and my right-hand closing over the top of the handle, was supposedly the right method to apply maximum force. I had thought my height advantage may have served me well. Within an hour, my soft hands were sore and painful and Sam put me onto "lighter duties "whilst he made light work of the rest of the plot. Over the years he'd turned a small parcel of land loaned to him by a farmer at Higher Thornton Farm, into a productive site for growing vegetables and fruit.</p>
                <p>It fed his family during the post war austerity years of rationing and long after his regular excursions to "this little bit of heaven" as he once referred to it, fed not only his growing family, but also his soul. Here, he would stop and sit on an old low-lying limestone wall and "breath in the view". I feel pretty sure that if Sam were alive today, he could settle the question I pondered privately, as to whether the spade we saw was a Devon or an Irish Shovel. Any difference was slight and as much as I would have liked to ask Charles for his opinion on such an interesting and contentious issue, I didn't dare risk it. The journey was too important to risk on such trifles. If the late great Sam was still around, I have little doubt he would have known that there is very little difference between the two. Both are equally good for digging holes particularly in clay soils and where there may be a difference, it can best be compared when side by side: The Devon shovel has a slightly wider and flatter face and the Irish shovel a longer pointed tipped blade. I felt to have troubled Charles with these burning questions may have elicited, after a few hours, the response that the best way to compare the shovel was to place it somewhere the Sun doesn't shine. </p>
                <Header as="h1">Exe Cleave.</Header>
                <Image src={img8} fluid rounded />
                <br />
                <p>With these burning thought in my mind, Charles and I walked the high grassland plateau that overlooks the river and Ware Ball on the opposing side of the valley. All the while, seeking out a good point to make the descent into Exe Cleave, which we did by following one of the folds in the hill. We were once again, more closely re-united with the river and followed its sweep around Long Barrow to a stretch of the river, just opposite Orchard Bottom and Rams Combe. Here, we alighted for our lunch. Within view was the entry of Sparcombe Waters into the Exe, following the steep descent mounds near Larkbarrow Corner. This is part of the route followed by <b>The Exmoor Perambulations</b>, which has its origins in the touring and inspection of the Royal Forests boundaries stretching back over seven hundred years. It was re-instated in 1983, as an annual walking challenge around the perimeter of the former Exmoor Royal Hunting Estate as it existed at the time of its sale in 1818. The course runs for 31-miles, or the shorter distance of 15-miles, taking place mid-June, to ensure walkers have the longer hours for a relaxed walk for pleasure and exercise. The walks begin at The Pinkery Centre, not far from Pinkery Pond, and ends either there or for the shorter walk at <b>Picked Stones Lane</b>. This was the area, where much of the speculative Knight mining took place. The ruins of the cottages and former mine at Wheal Eliza are still there. The mine, long ago closed and tapped is now hidden by vegetation, a softer reminder of poor Anna Maria Burgess, whose dead body was discovered at the base of the mine. Murdered by her Father, she has lain since 1858, in the churchyard at St Luke’s. Between 1857 with the discovery of iron ore deposits and intermittently through until 1914, attempts were made to develop the area for full-scale mining, but only met with partial success and with the advent of The First World War, the reserves of ore had been largely exploited and the issues of transporting the ore never fully resolved. <b>Gallon House</b>, which stands on the Simonsbath to Exford Road, was formerly a substantive farmhouse built by the Knights and for a period a licensed house known as The Red Deer. It subsequently gained its new name by the measure of beer the miners would take away with them. The pub had a reputation for fights breaking out among the miners and Irish labourers (15) or anyone foolish enough to bring up the subject of which shovel is the best. Some of the cattle sheds seen along the way, built solidly of stone, but many now in a pitiful state may well have been former miners’ cottages. It is sometimes hard to imagine such a peaceful semi-moorland area once played host to the mining industry. Once the occupation was redundant, the spoils, adits, mines and buildings swiftly were abandoned. Nature has reclaimed much of their appearance, making it sometimes difficult to see the former hand of mining. It is to the air and the view from above, that can reveal to the un-initiated, the traces of the past, easily missed at ground level.</p>
                <Header as="h1">Osbert Crawford (1886-1957).</Header>
                <p>My attention was drawn to the aerial photographs revealing the drainage system established by the Knights at <b>Sparcombe Water Head</b>. The intention had been to drain the land around <b>Tom's Hill</b>. The evidence for this came from aerial photographs taken by the Royal Air Force (RAF) between 1946-1948 and show seven drainage ditches which from ground level appear less visible. This brought to mind a biography by Kitty Hauser (18) about Osbert Crawford, one of the early exponents of aerial archaeology. It seems that his boyhood forays into the Wiltshire countryside to explore the ancient barrows, mounds and by-ways, were as much an escape from hardships of his public-school life as fanning an early interest in Archaeology. His fledgling archaeological career in this field whilst undertaking an excavation in Sudan, was cut short by outbreak of The First World War. He returned to the U.K in 1914 to enlist and soon found action commanding a platoon of the London Scottish on the front line at Givenchy. He was taken out of active duties when he contracted flu and malaria and brought to Birmingham for hospital treatment. Once pronounced fit, he sought and successfully maneuvered through family connections to secure a post in the army's map department as a Maps Officer with the Topographical Section. Part of his role was taking panorama photographs of the front line, often at some risk to himself when operating from forward sections to get the best viewpoint. He used a tripod to revolve the camera and a periscope to see the enemy lines from above the parapet, which was perhaps as well as the camera was struck by a sniper's bullet. As part of the process of providing more detailed maps, The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) were engaged in aerial photography taken over enemy lines. Crawford developed a keen eye for being able to read the details of the landscape for the information that could be of use to intelligence gathering and military planning.</p>
                <p>By the autumn of 1916, he was 3,000 feet up in the air over the Somme front and by January 1917, he had applied to join to join the RFC as an Observer. His service was a relatively short one, having been forced to make an emergency landing on his maiden trip and receiving a nasty wound to his right foot that put him in hospital for six months. Whilst recuperating at Heligan House in Cornwall, he began to write a book, “Man and His Past “. He advocated the use Archaeology and the study of the landscape as a way of understanding the evolution of civilization. He subscribed to a view, shared by other writers and academics, about the corrupting evils of Religion, Industrialisation, Capitalism and Nationalism. His contention was that if pre-history could be better understood, it might be possible to work out how things had gone wrong. Archaeology offered an important line of discovery and information on this. The hope was that re-discovering the ancient ways might offer some guide and support to a new World Order, that would hopefully arise out of the tragedy of the war. Returning to operational observer duties in the autumn of 1917, he went onto be taken as a prisoner of war when the plane, he and the pilot were flying, ended up mistakenly off course way behind enemy lines. They were forced to land and swiftly taken prisoner.</p>
                <p>Repatriated at the end of the war, Crawford went to live with a relative in Donnington, near Newbury and resumed independent archaeological fieldwork. He took advantage of the free maps available to 'certain qualified persons' who in return, submitted archaeological information to Ordnance Survey. So industrious was he in this respect, that he ended up in the Summer of 1920, being offered the full-time post as the Ordnance Survey's first Archaeological Officer. Crawford went to work in Southampton and moved into a house in Nursling, Hampshire. There is a great photograph of him outside his garage in Nursling. He is holding his solid looking bicycle (I like to imagine a Pashley) loaded with all manner of photographic paraphernalia, provisions and maps. A sturdy pair of binoculars are slung over his neck. Crawford wears a thick tweed jacket, large mittens, woollen cardigan completely buttoned up and trousers tucked behind cycle clips. For good measure, he wears his old airman's leather helmet over his head. It marked a period of his life when he busily cycled around various counties undertaking fieldwork to verify the existence and discovery of ancient monuments.</p>
                <p>Crawford had the good sense to build up a self- styled network of "ferrets", amongst fellow amateur antiquarians and archaeologists in support of this major undertaking. His background experience and connection with the RAF, enabled him to enlist their help. They provided him with aerial photographs thought to have some archaeological information or interest. Crawford recognised the value of aerial photography as a way of identifying historic sites on “the face of the land “, that were either unknown or hard to discern at ground level. In 1924, Crawford found a generous benefactor who was prepared to fly a plane and enable Crawford to locate and photograph places of archaeological interest. This revealed much previously unseen and unknown places of archaeological interest. Many of the sites appeared at risk of being lost amongst the spread of urbanisation. These Ariel photographs formed part of a valuable archive available to this day. It has survived due to Crowley's securing large parts of it in his garage just before the Ordnance Southampton was destroyed during a bombing raid in November 1940. However, a great deal of precious irreplaceable material was lost. What was saved, thanks to his intervention, is now held at The Oxford Archaeological Society. Included in this archive, is the collection of his literary output and photographic work connected to his growing interest with Communism. This might have possibly brought him into contact with my Great, Great Paternal Grandmother, Julia Grout (1870-1952) who lived at Percy Street, near to Kings Cross Station, London. Not far away, along Pentonville Road, stood the George IV pub, which was run by her Pubilcan Son, Frederick Henry Keen (1891-1970). From the pub, where my Father Alan Conridge was living at the time, he was dispatched by his Grandfather, to take down some bottles of beer the short distance, to his Great Grandmother's lodgings just a few streets away. My Father, remembers Julia as an elderly woman living in one of the terraced houses of the area. He also recalled her recounting a time when a team of researchers (one of whom I would imagine was Crawford) were trying to identify 30, Holford Square, where Lenin and his Wife, Krupskaya had lived between 1902-3. The researchers knocked on her door trying to locate the house and asked her if she had any memories of the couple.</p>
                <p>In recording some 10,000 photographs of the British landscape, Crawford believed he was providing a valuable future archive. He hoped to show the visual evidence for "Bloody Old Britain", the title of a book he wrote in the late 1930's, about the sorry state of the country in the wake of Capitalism, militarism and social inequalities. The photographic record, it was hoped would help to educate the masses as to the benefits of a new socialist world order that he felt was necessary and inevitable. What superseded this, was the onset of The Second World War and his secondment to the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments of England. During his tenure, he set about photographically documenting Southampton for the National Buildings Record and produced some 5,000 photographs of lasting architectural and historic importance. Some of his best work, in my humble opinion, concerns his attention to the small architectural details that make up of everyday life. In observing examples of door handles, taps and switches, he was recording the daily life and experience of the people who lived in these buildings. I find common cause with this interest in the human hand on our landscape.  </p>
                <Header as="h1">Westermill Linhay.</Header>
                <Image src={img9} fluid rounded />
                <br />
                <p>Resuming our walk, we crossed a makeshift wooden panelled bridge onto the land belonging to <b>Westermill Farm</b>. Nearby, is Westermill Linhay, fed by a former leat and yet further past evidence of attempts to harness the land to cultivation. A more modern-day adaption to farming, comes in the form of a caravan and camping park that has become established here. No doubt it has helped support the upkeep of the farm and enabled holiday-makers to enjoy the surrounding landscape. This was a much-loved valley by the look of things. Dotted about were plantations of native deciduous trees and the hedgerows we passed seemed to be in a good state of management. Rather than the ravaged seared hedges, often thinly spread with metal fencing compensating for the soulful gaps in their midst, these hedges seemed to have been layered by skilled hands in the past few years. New growth had formed a denser stock-proofing form, providing a welcome protective habitat for small mammals, insects and birds. It therefore came as little surprise to learn that The Exmoor Trust has awarded prizes to the best laid hedgerows in the area for several years. As the farm track ended, we stepped onto a small country lane that took us past the small hamlet of <b>Wellshead</b>. This is where as Exmoor legend has it, that a headless sow has been seen running with her litter. If that isn't bad enough, at nearby, <b>Downscombe</b>, another legend states that some poor chap decided to allow himself to be tied up to a tree in order that he might witness a certain "something" to emerge at night from one of the nearby barrow mounds. We will never know, as in the morning he was found dead.</p>

                <Header as="h1">Silly Bridge.</Header>
                <Image src={img11} fluid rounded />
                <br />
                <p>Our route took us happily in the direction of the pleasingly named <b>Silly Bridge</b>. With a name like this, it was well worth a visit, even if the reason for calling it this are not obvious. It is a narrow little single arching bridge much in keeping with many of the ancient bridges found along our route. However, it was a nice place to stop and admire the water chuntering below and the dappled light breaking on its surface. I was mindful too, of how many centuries it has served the passage of countless weary feet and hooves, cart wheels and now brave motorists manoeuvring over its narrow path. The bridge would have provided a valuable crossing for the prominent farms in the area, including <b>Riscombe Farm</b> (where I presumed, one of the cottages was the home of the unfortunate William Stenner mentioned earlier at Pinkery Pond). The bridge was, but one, of several crossing points over the Exe from the ancient <b>Room Hill Road</b> that traverses Exmoor from Dulverton to Combe Martin, on the coast. A few months later, I came across two books on the subject of Devon bridges in one of the local charity bookshops, I occasionally visit in South Street, Exeter. The first (19) was, “The Ancient Bridges of The South West of England “(1930) and the second (20), “Old Devon Bridges “(1938). Both are now highly prized additions to the over-burdened bookshelves in my house. The author of both books, was the Architect and Antiquarian, <b>Edwyn Jervoise (1884-1954)</b>, who wrote several books on the bridges of England in collaboration with The Society for the protection of Ancient Buildings. Unfortunately, Silly Bridge didn't get a mention in either of the books, although they have been instructive on other bridges found along the way. What caught my attention, was the back story to the book, Old Devon Bridges. The original idea and research were conceived by <b>Charles Henderson MA. Oxon</b>, but alas, he had passed away in 1926, before the book had really got off the ground. It seems that a note written by Henderson and published in The Western Morning News in June 1926, announcing an intended survey of the bridges in Devon, brought about some correspondence between the two men prior to his death. Henderson's Widow, made the request to Jervoise, that he complete the book, that her late Husband had started. The resulting book was a fine tribute to his late friend and has an opening photograph of the title page, as written by the late Charles Henderson in June 1926. It includes the following quote, “It's rivers indeed are beautiful, clear, vocal, stony streams with old bridges dangerously narrow and angles in them like the corners of an English mince pie for the foot passenger to take shelter in “(19).</p>

                <p>Having made the crossing over the Exe, there did not appear to be any footpaths along the side of the river and we were reluctant to make our way up to <b>Muddicombe Cross</b>. This only served to take us some distance from the river before we could return to it via Yealscombe Lane and the next footbridge. Charles proved yet again clear-sighted in the matter. By crossing a nearby field, we were able to walk along the border of a woodland overlooking a stretch of river below, marked on the map as <b>The Tunnel</b>. We came across our next footbridge just below Yealscombe and over this through to the rather lovely little hamlet of <b>Edgcott</b>. Here and there were whitewashed cottages, high hedges and well attended gardens. The quiet ambience put me in mind of the fictional village landscape portrayed in the BBC's production of Miss Marple from one of the Agatha Christie's books. On our way, we walked close to <b>Edgcott House</b>, the former home of <b>Major Moorland John Greig (1864-1915)</b>. His memorial is on the nave wall at the nearby St Mary Magdalene Parish Church of Exford, whereas, his body, like so many servicemen killed in action during The First World War, is buried at Karakoe, Sulva Bay. His Son, Richard who was “lost at sea” in March 1941, would have been just eleven years of age, when his Father took part in his last hunt meeting as Master of The Devon and Somerset Stag Hunt. Immediately after this, he joined his regiment, The Royal North Devon Hussars and was just 50 years of age when he was killed in action during the ill-fated Gallipoli Campaign on October 17th, 1915. Leaving, the road, Charles and I found a footpath through a field taking us back to the river. Crossing a footbridge, close to where Edgcott Water joins the river. From there, we followed the short footpath past small copses and fields until we came to the outskirts of Exford the first substantive conurbation along the stretch of the river we had thus passed. Close by still remains The Kennels for The Devon and Somerset Stag Hunt (established 1875).</p>

                <p className="quote">“Exford has the same appearance of remoteness as Withypool, but its isolation is not so depressing. In summer and autumn it is taxed by the numerous visitors“.</p>
                <p className="quote-credit">Rambles in Somerset 1912.</p>
                <p>Leaving the footpath, we stepped down onto the B3224, which led us down into the village and towards the river. Ahead we could see the bridge which serves as the busy crossing point for the village. It would have been easy to miss an unassuming muddy track leading down to the river. As it was, we needed to clean our boots before getting into the car and this took us to the original fording point across the river. Rambles in Somerset (1) provides an interesting insight into the use of the ford in 1912. “The village, as its name implies, clings to the side of the defile which the traveller has to descend to cross the Exe. The fording of the river could seldom have been a formidale undertaking except in desperate weather, for the stream is here but a mountain burn, silvery and shallow“. Much could have been said on this day too. However, this would be to overlook the impact severe floods have had on the area. The Solid stone walls at the side of the river have been built to protect the nearby properties from flooding. The flood of 1952, washed away the stables and horses of the nearby Exmoor White Horse Inn, as I discovered during a brief chat with Chris, a retired Ranger with the Exmoor National Park, who kindly took a little time out from repairing a stone wall by the side of the road. I was interested to know what type of fish were to be found along this stretch of river and further upstream and was told it was home to Exmoor Brown Trout, Minnows and Salmon. Some of these fish caught locally appear on the menu of <b>The Exmoor White Horse Inn</b>, bedecked in Virginia creeper and standing prominently on the other side of the river. The ford is clearly no longer used and the traffic and pedestrians pass over a bridge built in 1930. This is where, we crossed and walked up <b>Chapel Street</b>.in the direction of the village car park. I should have liked to have spent more time in the village, but unfortunately the further away from our home bases and commitments, the less time there was for some detours. This prompted me to make many return trips to the places, Charles and I passed along the river. It allowed me to fill in the considerable gaps in my knowledge as well satisfying my curiosity. Several months later, I returned with my partner, Kathy, picking up the trail of Chapel Street and quickly located the old chapel which has now been adapted into a private dwelling. A small potted account found in N.V. Allen's priceless little book on Churches and Chapels of Exmoor (21) gives an indication as to the faltering planting of Methodism in Exford. It began with a Mr W. Adams opening his house to services in 1811, only for this to founder due to a poor response, the fierce elements (on one occasion snowed in for a fortnight) and poor communications.</p>

                <p>Efforts continued to establish a congregation and by 1838, the chapel was built and in keeping with its humble origins, sparse and functional. In 1949, the chapel was the beneficiary of two stain-glassed displays of two angels playing musical instruments and set into two narrow windows which "shone out in brilliant blues, reds and gold". The glass was the work of Edward Burne- Jones, a 19c Pre-Raphaelite painter. The glass was salvaged from a London Chapel during the war years and donated to the Exford Chapel in memory of two friends by Cyril Scott. He was a wealthy musical composer and author, who had taken refuge in Exford during The Second World War. During the floods in August 1952, the chapel was badly damaged and later restored. However, falling numbers of the congregation led to its closure in 1979 and the glass was removed at this time. Standing outside, gave me pause to think about the role, chapels and meeting houses, have played in the life of villages and towns of so many of the places visited. My first awakening to the heritage of chapels came during a period, I used to travel regularly to North Wales. I remember being impressed by the variety of names found above the entrances to these places of worship. Names such as Salem, Moriah and Elim, stand out in my memory and, as now seem curiously out of step with modern times. I thought little more about it at the time until more recently, when I stood on a sodden grass bank and leaning across to a broken window to gain a view inside the Jerusalem Calvinist Methodist Chapel (1824) in Pontrhydyfen, near Port Talbot. This is where the famous Welsh actor, Richard Burton's family used to attend. In the gloomy light of that grey dull overcast day, I could see the dusty ranks of empty pews and balconies. Once these seated the congregations of former mining families, their names long carved on the rain-washed slate memorial stones around the windswept sodden graveyard. The large pulpit stood at the back wall facing the entrance to the chapel and in front of it, a large solid table where communion would have been taken. In this sprawling former mining town, I saw at least one chapel boarded up, like so many around Wales, that have closed in the post war years. This does not dampen the strong association of chapels in the cultural view of Wales. Devon certainly has its own tradition of non-conformism. Peter Beacham, in his book (22) Down the deep lanes (2008) wrote that in 1851, a census of churches and chapels showed that out of 1,297 places of worship in Devon, over half were non- Anglican. Many had their origins in the Dissenter traditions in the wake of the Reformation and the 19c surge of Methodism. Many breakaway congregations produced a range of interesting titles; e.g. Bible Christians, Presbyterians, Primitive Methodists along with a style of chapel reflecting often their humble origins in the plainness of their appearance, both inside and out. Whilst the future of chapels is uncertain, they still retain a toe-hold in many of the villages and towns, I have explored.</p>

                <p>My interest in their heritage and decline, has to an extent been fuelled by the rich legacy of the photographic record produced by James Ravilious. His collaboration with Peter Beacham on the book, “Down the Deep Lanes“(22) has been an inspirational book for me. It owes much to the intimate quality of Ravilious' eye for a good photographic subject, as it does to Beacham's knowledge of the Devonshire landscape and its historic buildings. Not for nothing, was Beecham highly regarded as the counties first Conservation Officer. The book provides a portrait of a Devon, that has disappeared or fast receding. It is a fitting tribute to the work Ravilious had begun in 1972 (some five years after Beecham had taken up his Conservation role in 1967), when he moved to the North Devon village of Dolton with his Wife, Robin and their young family. He took on the commission offered by The Beaford Centre, to make a photographic archive of photographs of North Devon. The photographs provide a fascinating insight into the lives and activities of these rural communities. Some of my favourite photographs record the congregations of the various chapels and churches spread across North Devon. They show the various ways in which the chapel and church played an important part in the life of the community. In photographing these community activities, Ravilious has left a treasured social record. On occasions, I have been to the chapels and churches, he recorded. Some still linger on today, but others have now closed. I can't help thinking that Ravilious felt himself, a witness to the decline of many farming, village and small-town institutions. I believe this was at the core of what drove him in his photographic work. Even if you have not heard of Ravilious's name, there is a good chance that you may have come across his photographic work. Common Ground commissioned his work to raise awareness of the loss of Orchards and his book, “An English Eye (1998), has many photographs that have found their way onto postcards and frames around many people's homes. One image stands out for me. In black and white, it shows Archie Parkhouse, a Dolton small-holder, clutching a large paper bag over his hatted head to shield him from the sleet. In his other hand he holds some ivy to feed his sheep (23). Robin Ravilious in her biography (24) of her late Husband, wrote about how Ravilious had delighted in the prospect that he might have captured a good photograph, having risked pointing the camera directly at Archie as they stood together. It appears that Archie didn't mind a bit and the resulting portrait was amongst Ravilious' favourite photographs. It is one of mine too.</p>

                <p>At the heart of the Exford, surrounded by cottages and the village store and illuminated in full morning sunshine glory, was the village green. Nearby, was a café and having had quite a long drive, this is where Kathy and I stopped for refreshment. The menu was presented with the cover of ‘The secret book of the Gnomes’. A nice touch, I thought. Whilst we were waiting for our order, I glanced at a leaflet advertising The Exmoor Dark Skies Festival. This offers a range of night-time activities which have as their theme a celebration of the night skies. They take place all over the Exmoor from a Stellar Pizza Meal and quiz at Simonsbath, to a Night Navigation and Star gazing meeting at Goat Hill, near Pinkery. There was one more place, I hoped to see. <b>St Mary Magdalene Church</b> stands high above the village and was originally dedicated to St Salvyn a Celtic missionary who came over from Wales during the Dark Ages. To the side of the outside east porch wall is the barely decipherable epitaph to Richard Gould, placed in his memory by his Widow who died in 1865 having reached the ripe old age of 106. A helpful information board gave the inscription, which frankly, I couldn't read. “A Husband dear, who in the Lord did trust. Beneath this stone lies silent in the dust. Till the last Trump shall sound and bid him rise. To meet his blessed Saviour in the skies”. The board also directed us to the gravestone of Amos Cann, buried near the churchyard gate. It informed us, that during the harsh winter of 1891, Mr Cann was caught out in the open, when walking back to the village from Porlock. It was three weeks before his frozen body was found. The churchyard cross standing in the churchyard was broken in half possibly by the Parliamentarians and even then, dated back many centuries to before the time of the Norman Conquest. Perhaps, because the cross had been broken, it acquired the local name as the Crying Stone. It was for many centuries, a place where notices of local gatherings would be announced.</p>
                <p>Nearby, I noticed a wooden bench dedicated to the memory of <b>Major Wendy Haswell Wilson Swales (1933-1997)</b> with the simple epitaph “Died near here. Prayed for here. Donated by comrades and friends”. He lived a full and interesting life taking part in an alphabetical roll call of sports, ranging from Boxing to Yachting. He served in The Royal Marines and later, with the Parachute Regiment. This led onto him taking part in a number of outward-bound expeditions, supporting young people in trekking around far flung places. Eventually, it led to him setting up his own expedition company. It was whilst walking on Exmoor with friends and his memorial seat is a good place to sit and admire the view. You can look across the Exe Valley and the crest along which the prehistoric ridgeway travelled and now forms Room Hill Road. The interior of the church was colourfully adorned with kneelers and cushions, displaying the life and traditions of the village. My eye was drawn to the elegant paintings on the wooden panelling on the church organ (1924) but if I have any memory of the day it was the chance meeting with <b>Mary Bawden</b> and her friend, Jackie Boyes. Mary had arranged flowers to decorate the church and we fell into a brief conversation. Mary has attended the church for most of her life and taken an active part in the choir. Now, in poorer health, she attends with Jackie to do the flower displays. I had hoped to meet her again to find out more of her story, but her health made this undertaking too difficult to arrange, so I simply record the pleasure of meeting Mary and admiring her connection to the life of the church. </p>
