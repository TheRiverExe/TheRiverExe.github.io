                    <p>Crossing the bridge at Exebridge was not straight forward, especially as we timed our attempt just as two large buses pulled up to opposite sides of the bridge. It felt for a moment as if we were caught in the middle of a War of the Buses between Devon and Somerset. I am not sure what the outcome was, as we decided to get over the bridge in double quick time and let them sort it out. We walked gingerly up the side of the road until we found a lane to our left, leading towards Exeham Farm and fortunately came almost immediately across an open gate with access to the river beyond. Before us was a wide-open expanse of fields framed by the rise of wooded hill tops in the distance and the prospect of a nice sunny day. Its aspect seemed to welcome the day and our next leg of the walk. It made for a good start to what was for me, one of the nicest walks of the odyssey.</p>
                    <p>This is clearly Fishing Territory. Izzak Walton’s passion seems to extend along much of the Exe as several fishermen huts close to the banks revealed. I particularly like one with a large pair of wading boots hung over the veranda. In the distance, sat snugly on the side of a thickly wooded hill, was Hele Manor. What an aspect this house must have with open sweep of fields and valley and the all-important river nearby. Such a setting must have been a delight for the Architect, Horace Cowley Nesham Farquharson (1874-1966). With an impressive name like that alone, he must have seemed eminently qualified to have designed this “good example of an Edwardian Gentleman's country residence", He certainly appears to have established a successful practice in London specialising in the design of country houses and in the course of his career. Working as an assistant to Sir Edward Lutyens, a prominent Architect, must have been helpful to his career and connection with the West Country. Castle Drogo, near Drewsteignton was one of the commissions, Lutyens was engaged in and remains a popular National Trust site to this day. The War Memorial at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, another design by Lutyens, also has some relevance to the family, that once owned Hele Manor as we will see.</p>
                    <p>Hele Manor was built for Lieutenant-Colonel Harry William Ludovic Heathcoat- Amory (1870-1945), although the house may not have been completely ready until the end of the First World War. His name is certainly linked with the hunting tradition along the Exe and the first of many Heathcoat- Amory connections with the river, its adjoining estates, business and hunting. I had in this respect, the guide of Jeremy Whitehorn's excellent book on the history of the Tiverton Foxhounds (47). A photograph taken in 1911, shows an elderly Sir John Heathcoat-Amory standing in the doorway of Knightshayes House, near Tiverton surrounded by three of his sons all attired in hunting regalia. Sir John's own passage into the hunting world and breeding of stag-hounds was assisted by the prosperity of his textile business at Heathcote, in Tiverton. More of this later. Sir John also enjoyed a mutually supportive relationship with his Brother-in-law, Squire Ludovic Unwin, of Bolham House and Master of the Tiverton Foxhounds. Can it be a co-incidence then, that two of the Squire’s sons in the photograph, shared the name Ludovic in their roll call of names. In the case of (as he was in 1911) Captain Harry William Ludovic Heathcoat-Amory, he had been educated at Eton and gone onto join The Coldstream Guards. He was Master of The Staghounds and Deputy Lieutenant for Somerset. Married in 1898, he and his Wife, Evelyn Mary produced a Son and two Daughters. Harry went onto see action with The Somerset Light Infantry and survived both the war and his first Wife, who died in 1929; he re-marrying in Marjorie Una in 1931. It might be said that he fared better than his much younger brother, Captain Ludovic Heathcoat- Amory (1881-1918) who seems to embody the tragedy that befell so many of his generation during The First World War and commemorated at the Cenotaph. His start fortunately got him off to a good start. Having the advantages of a wealthy background, he attended Eton and went onto study and play cricket for Oxford University and in doing so played overseas in South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
                    <p>He found time from his busy sporting life to marry Ms Mary Stuart Bannatyne in July 1911. She was the daughter of James Fitzpatrick, who was the owner of Haldon House nestling above the Haldon Hills near Exeter. The couple had three sons, all of whom would perish prematurely; one in a flying accident in 1936 and the other two falling at El Alamein (1942) and Normandy (1944) suffering the same martial death that befell their Father, whom they would barely have known. In 1917, Heathcoat- Amory volunteered to join the Royal Devon Yeomanry and was later transferred to the Royal Artillery and at the age of just 37 and just three months short of the Armistice in the last year of the war, succumbed to injuries inflicted at Bayonvillers on the Western Front. He had continued to ride and hunt behind the front-line, in a much-improvised manner and as his duties had permitted. His records of these hunts are written in a somewhat jaunty manner, explained by Jeremy Whitethorn "as a whooping glimmer of sanity amid the plodding misery of conflict (sic) it was probably as rip-roaring as it was possible to get". Not far from where Charles and I were walking, stood a large mature Oak tree in the middle of the field surrounded by a circle of tall grass and creating an island effect. I did wonder if it was one of the trees that Heathcoat- Amory may have had planted during his tenure. Of all memorials such a magnificent tree is a pretty good one.</p>

                    <p>As it was, the morning sunshine was gaining height and energy. You could feel its heat and intensity building in such an open space, but enclosed within the tall valley sides. The air was thick with the heavy smell of evaporating moisture gradually lifting from the dew-soaked grasses. In places, where there were patches of ground more shaded, the early morning dew bejewelled the grasses and adorned cobwebs spun.  valley into a furnace. On the grasses and the heat that hot sweaty July day was pretty relentless. The wide-open space was beginning to narrow as we approached the entry of Brookey River into the Exe and a stretch of woodland. Here the valley became more constricted either side with tall hills covered with mixed woodland. Entering the wood, we followed a number of shady paths that hugged the side of the hills. Where there was dense larch growing the air was significantly cooler and fresh and the light more dappled and less intense. It gave me a real sense of how woodlands act as a shield against the glare of sunshine and absorb so much of its energy. Perhaps, it is a measure of the latter; the rise in heat and influx of light, that encourages the traffic of insects. The place seemed alive to the sounds of humming and buzzing. Where the banks rose high above the path, it was interesting to observe more closely the detail of countless little micro-worlds amongst the stony cliffs and vegetation. Towering above us were the tall columns of trunks splayed randomly across the slopes and forming a maze-like hinterland. Into this beautiful landscape, the imagination can easily be drawn to the depths of the woodland and its air of drama.</p>

                        src3={Media.img7} />
                    <p>The thickness and density of the wood also disguised the signs of mining that still continues in pockets of the valley to this day. At Highleigh there are quarries that produce aggregate, but the quarrymen no longer necessarily live in the former shacks and mining cottage, many of which have been converted into holiday homes. The remains of the former mining we came across revealed themselves amidst the undergrowth, their stone or concrete structures covered in ivy and brambles. Where rusting corrugated iron remained, there was imprint of splays of light in between the silhouette of dappled leaves. We now reached a lane, steeped either side by dry-stone walls, that led towards a farmhouse. Below this, was Highleigh Bridge, a deceptively makeshift affair with threaded planks with large gaps between and a cone to mark the largest gap. The farmhouse looked to be having some major construction work and I noticed a lorry laden with heavy building material on the other side of the bridge. A driver, faced with the prospect of delivering this load clearly was having what seemed like urgent conference with someone checking out how safe the bridge was to drive across.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img8} />
                    <p>Luckily for us the only consideration our nimble feet had to mind were the gaps. Having negotiated our way to the middle of the bridge, we took a little time to enjoy the views; something, I don’t think would have been the lorry driver’s priority. It was truly splendid. Claude Monet would have enjoyed the candelabra feast of light bearing down through the canopy of trees and spread across the soupy green river. Where heavily laden branches arched closely to the surface of the water, the ripples drew down the colours and shades into a tiered dreamlike watery landscape. This also turned out to be the first occasion, where Charles caught a fleeting sight of a blue and orange coloured kingfisher rapidly making its way downstream. This is what Charles told me, as it passed unseen to me. It would prove to be the first of a number of occasions, where the first and only moment, I would know about this beautiful bird flying past, was the call "Kingfisher" from Charles and his pointing in the direction it had disappeared. Crossing the bridge, passed the hapless lorry driver and picked up a stretch of the road until we could find a gap in the hedge and return to the side of the river. This took us through another steep-sided wooded valley until we reached Oakfordbridge.</p>

                    <p>An old mill has stood at Oakfordbridge since Norman times and probably before that. One of the first things the Norman's instituted was a record (The Domesday Book) of what was now under their possession and control and the mill at Oakfordbridge was listed at the time. It remained in operation right up until the 1950's. Now in retirement, it has earned the distinction of being a listed building and retains much of the original features and machinery. I only managed to get an outside peep of the leat and its long passageway through the side of the house (later period) that adjoined the mill. For many Devon mills, granite stone was used, although some mills imported stone from North Derbyshire, however discoloration of the flour meant that from the 17c onwards, cleaner French stone was imported. It was also cut and assembled in a bound manner rather than one large round stone, to do the crushing. This is what Kathy and I had seen used at Bridgetown and I realise, I am fast becoming an authority on the subject. The process was wearing for the stone, which every two to three weeks needed attention with lifting and fresh "furrows" (grooves) cut. The medieval bridge (reconstructed in 1994) at one time carried the old road from Bampton to South Molton and takes you through the village of Oakford, which was somewhere I returned to a few months later, when I went to visit Bun Burrows. I do not know if the bridge took the line of the older fording point, but it most likely was there, long before the building of the bridge was undertaken. Opposite the mill is a fine orchard of what appears to be traditional varieties. It was on an autumn day a year later, that I returned and enjoyed the selection of colours and abundance of apples hung around their branches. The orchard sits on the land between the river and the leat and as a consequence is well watered. There are still the sluice gates, which at one time would have adjusted the flow of water into the redundant leat passing under the former mill. The water now flows past a much smaller ruin of a former stone built shed. By its side, a sunken waterwheel wedged into the soil and vegetation, so that it is barely recognisable. In former times, the orchard and the still active leat, disappearing under a hedge, may well have been part of the estate of Hamslade House. On the map it shows fisheries further downstream and on land presumably owned by The Stuckeridge Estate (which we will come to a little later in this chapter) and the water may have served this. Beyond the mill and leading past a former forge, you travel up the incredibly steep and windy lane to Hamslade Cross. It gives some idea of the terrain pack-horses had to endure although they travelled without the benefit of a tarmacked surface. For now, Charles and I, re-joined the A396, because there was no prospect of an open route along the riverbank from either side of the bridge. So, reluctantly tramping along the road, we kept our eyes peeled for a suitable gap in a hedge and having found one, Charles led the way, whilst I held back a moment. In what seemed like a bolt out of nowhere, a car came hurtling towards us and I was just able to step up onto the verge to avoid being hit. I felt quite shaken and never more pleased than to follow Charles through the gap and onto a car free field. From here the walk was straight-forward and my nerves soon settled in the warm sunshine and steady progress.</p>

                    <p>The junction at Black Cat, close to Stuckeridge Bridge is a challenge to anyone trying to navigate the sharp corner between the Bampton road (B227) and the A369. Traffic converges from all directions. There comes a moment, when any amount of checking mirrors and craning the neck to see if the way is clear, nonetheless requires a leap of faith. Luck too, may play a part and I can’t help thinking this is where the black cat came in. Right in the middle of the grassed junction are a couple mature Copper Beech Tree and opposite, a garage, itself with an equally distinct character. For years I have joined the ranks of many motorists noting its quaint appearance and thinking it would be nice to have a closer look some time. When I was doing some research, I discovered someone else who has been similarly inspired. Andrew Parker has developed an enthusiasm for photographing in fine style, old privately-run garages and petrol stations (previously with attended petrol pump service) around the South West. His mission is to record as many as he can as they are disappearing from the roadside landscape and heritage. For a time, Charles helped a motorist get his bearings, whilst I had a closer look at the garage through the lens of the camera, hoping in some small way to record the traces of its previous existence. Over a year later, I returned with my friend, Robert, whose appreciation of motorbikes found a kindred spirit in Fred Awcock, the owner of the garage and the bungalow that sits overlooking the valley. Fred and his Wife, Ruth, took over the running of the Black Cat Garage and bungalow, from a Mr Rycroft in 1972. Fred brought his parents down for good measure. They had pooled their money and the plan had been to run the filling station and re-open the former café. The garage and bungalow had been built in in 1927 and rock had been blasted out to make space to accommodate the garage. Large chunks of the excavated rocks were also used to create a set of steps up to the bungalow which retains some of the original hardwood. Fred thought that the garage had been built for the chauffeur who drove the cars for The Kennard Family of Wonham House, just a short distance from Oakfordbridge. There was a Captain Malcom Alfred Kennard (1874-1934), who had occupied the house (still very much there) and who was a keen fisherman. He used to take his family to Iceland to fish for Salmon and had a lodge house built.</p>

                        src3={Media.img16} />
                    <p>Fred looked after the petrol filling side of the business, whilst Ruth (who by now had three sons) helped her Parents-in-law with the running of the café. The family all lived in the bungalow but adapted this to cater for the café. We were shown some old photos, one of the outdoor tea gardens replete with a maid neatly presented smiling warmly standing by tables neatly laid and shaded by parasols and wicker chairs. The same smiling maid is also seen standing attentively under the veranda holding a tray and waiting to attend to future customers. The family were certainly kept busy with the catering producing cooked breakfasts, cakes and cream teas; “making up to 300 weight of home-made jam!”. The gardens were already nicely landscaped with Torbay Palms, rhododendrons, Azaleas and other impressive shrubs all of which draw comment from passers-by. If you don’t feel like climbing the steps, there is an inclined path that crosses the garden and takes you close to the colourful display. The business flourished and in time, Fred used his background in Electrics and mechanics (and carpentry) to begin repair work on lawn-mowers and eventually cars and motorbikes. The garage and the café became a popular meeting place for fellow motor-bike enthusiasts, including Phil Read, Grand Prix and Isle of Man T.T motorcycle road racer. It seems he was interested in having a look at Fred’s Hesketh motorcycle. One of only 139 produced in the 1980’s, before the company went into liquidation. Fred also restores classic cars and produced some photos of fellow car and motorbike enthusiasts gathering outside the garage and having their photos taken with him.</p>

                    <p>Beginning work at 7.20am, he would keep an eye out for passing motorists wanting him to fill up their petrol tanks, sell them sweets, ice-creams, cigarettes and snacks. In between, he also began undertaking repairs on the cars and motors for people who lived locally. One of his visitors was Dr. Alex Moulton, designer and inventor of Moulton bikes, a company still producing these unconventional bikes to the present day and in collaboration with Pashely! Dr Moulton, used to come down from Bradford on Avon, in Wiltshire to visit his friend, Arthur Llewellyn of Stuckeridge House, but used to call on Fred to let him see his latest project and allow Fred to try them out. Fred showed us his Moulton bike and the unicycle, he learnt to ride just a few years ago, when his three sons cycled to Bampton and around the lanes to The Exeter Inn and back. The unicycle has pride of place in Fred’s beloved garage. I felt we had a very privileged view of the interior of the garage; not a sight so many people see today, as for the most part it is locked up. Surrounded by just about everything and anything that could have supplied a working garage and filling station in its heyday, the place resembles a working museum. Fred had a little office to the side, where in a drawer, he kept a record of all his customers going back to the 1970’s and books on car repairs. In the old days, he used to keep spares for at least four makes of car that were most popularly used. During his time running the business between 1972 and 2001, there were changes that began to affect the garage. He recalled the oil embargo of the 1970’s and then the motorway and the North Devon Link Road, which took business away from the garage and the many found along rural stretches of road.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img19} />
                    <p>One change, that I would never have guessed unless Fred had told us, was that part of his old garden was used to build a road, filing motorists across towards the nearby Stuckeridge Bridge. In effect, it meant that the triangular patch with the beech trees, I had admired, was at one time, part of his garden. Surprisingly few major accidents take place at this junction, presumably because motorists generally slow down and more importantly, the lucky charm of the black cat. I had noticed a quirky looking wooden shed, tucked away in the bottom garden. I had assumed it was a chicken shed. However, it turned out to be a give-away by a carpenter and entrepreneur, who’d hoped to persuade Harrods, in London, to sell these as flat-packed sheds, but with no success. Today, Fred likes to come down and potter away at his cars and talks of re-instating the Black Cat sign and re-painting the garage. The outside of the garage retains a wonderful character and throw back to a different time and may explain why Fred notices many classic car owners taking portraits of their cars from outside the garage forecourt. As, Fred was telling us this, a motorist did stop to take some photographs of the garage; just as I had done on the first occasion of visiting. I can quite see why it appealed to Andrew Parker and I wish his heritage project well.</p>

                    <p>Returning to the walk with Charles; we had approached Stuckeridge Bridge from the fields and before we walked over to Black Cat Garage, had walked in the underside of the bridge. The low water levels meant we could walk under one of the arches and look at the exposed pebble beds. The pale dressed stone was brightly illuminated in the fierce sunshine. The 19c bridge offered us some temporary shade beneath the rumble of traffic overhead. The heat of the day had put us firmly in mind of the need to cool off in the river and we considered this as we chose our route from here. I now know, that Fred’s sons used to swim in the river, close to the bridge; “up to eight feet deep in places”, but there was no prospect of Charles and I managing a swim here.  Having had a look around the outside of the garage, Charles and I made the crossing of the bridge. This allowed us to avoid the road and make our way along the river-bank with a woodland to our side. As we walked by the side of the river, we looked almost hungrily for a possible swimming location. We found our next swimming spot with a view of a weir just a short way down. Having set down our bags, we got into our swimming shorts and warily made our way into the river. The pebble beds were dried and desiccated due to the shrinkage in the volume of the water flowing down the Exe. It meant they were not slippery to walk on, but did occasionally give a burning sensation to the soles of the feet. Both Charles and I resembled two cats on a hot tin roof, as we attempted to find a reasonable depth to dip into the water.</p>

                    <p>I crouched down and scooped up some water in my hands and splashed water on my face. On such a day as this, it was lovely to feel the rapid cooling effect. However, its relief was only momentary. What I needed to do, was to submerge myself. Bending myself down, the pebbles dug into my knees but persisting, soon I was able to spread myself forward into the water. A few breast strokes and I was drifting in the gentle flow of the water with the sight of the weir drawing closer. Getting up close, I could see this was a large diagonal bedrock formation spread across the river. With an accumulation of rocks wedged tightly into its folds along with an accumulation of debris washed down by past floods, the effect was to create a solid barrier across the river. Nonetheless, the water, even in low ebb, continued to flow over this uneven natural watercourse. There was randomness of flows rather than a uniform one.  In normal flow, these rocks would be hidden from view. leaving just their signature on the water above. Now the rocks took on a distinct character all of their own, emerging as a mini landscape of waterfalls and rapids, pools and channels.</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img25} />
                    <p>I found a spot where the water was forcibly stronger and just about deep enough to slide over and aim for somewhere a little deeper. Seeing a large stone, I used this to steady myself to face the current of water. I wanted to feel the force of the water as it surged around me, only to find it gradually dislodging me, as I tried unsuccessfully to find a comfortable position. Exactly where the central point of the River Exe is, I do not know. However, this thought popped into my head as I sank my head under the water and felt the power of the water rushing over me. What I did know, was that on this sweltering dry hot day, basking in the cooling waters was, as fine a thing to experience, as anything else I could be doing. The same could not be said of the reckoning of the return trip.  Making my way back to the river-bank first over wet slippery pebbles made for an unsteady approach to the next sensation of the sticky mud. Not an unpleasant experience and highly prized (by others) at Glastonbury, but a devil to clean. The next obstacle was the scaling of its steep flaky sides and trying to find firm footholds and clumps of grass or anything, with which to lever myself up to the top of the bank. For good measure, there were the natural hazards of spikey thistles, stinging nettles and razor-sharp brambles. All this scrambling about and exhalation of carbon dioxide on my part must have proved irresistible to some hungry female horsefly. The back of my exposed left leg made for a perfect place to land for lunch. Un-noticed by me, she gripped my leg with her claws and using her sharp mouthparts, set about sawing into my skin. The bite was immediately painful and irritating and unlike many other animals that have no defence against this, I was able to sweep her away. However, the damage was done and for the rest of the walk and a days later I experienced some discomfort.</p>
                    <p>Lest this put you off river swimming, I urge you to rush out and buy a copy of Scouting for boys (1908) by Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden Powell. It might come in helpful. For a time, this book was one the most widely read books next to The Bible. Contained within its pages are exhortations for boys on how to be chivalrous, active and exercise self-discipline with lashings of stern lessons. It talks about self-improvement and citizenship “treat others as you would be treated" which actually seems like doesn't seem like such a bad thing, but I am getting away with myself. I feel sure Baden Powell would have encouraged us to continue with wild swimming and thrown in for good measure, advice about how to light a fire (something Charles is particularly handy at) or build a boat (unnecessary at this point) or how to stalk animals or robbers.! </p>

                    <p>In short measure, we came upon Chain Bridge, a metaled suspension bridge comprising sturdy chains, links and rivets. It looks very impressive from afar. Closer up, the view is no less pleasing if you share my appreciation for rust. The bridge is under attack from the corrosive forces of nature. Its lime green metal plating is pocketed in places with holes, as brown-red hue rust gradually devours its host. The strong sunlight made for a sharp comparison between the shaded river and banks below against the brightly illuminated skeletal form of the bridge. The effect was to create a vivid demonstration of how light can transform and accentuate the dramatic impression of things. The dark shading thrown by the bridge and the undergrowth along the banks, created a cold, dank and even faintly menacing underworld feel, in stark contrast to the sun-kissed appearance of the bridge. Here, the hard features became clear and detailed and warm to the touch. Clumps of mosses grasses that lined the rutted track and lodged in pockets and ledges of the bridge, added life and softness to the hard surfaces. There was a sense of Nature re-asserting itself. Altogether the bridge impressed me with its graceful appearance. In days gone by, (and I suspect to a very limited extent today) the bridge and its neighbouring elaborate gate house (neatly thatched and colonnaded) served Stuckeridge House. We could have had no view of this as we walked along the river, situated some way back from the western side of wooded valley. The bridge provided a useful southerly crossing over the Exe avoiding the steeper valley through which Iron Mill Stream flows into the river, emerging just a short distance from the bridge.</p>

                    <p>At each stage of revisiting the walk, I have pored over maps to find out more about the places we passed. Then, assisted by an array of books, magazines and the internet, tried to blend whatever I found of interest or note, into the narrative of this account. It has been a journey of discovery, learning and reflection and altogether welcome. A good example of this is reflected in my research for the history of Stuckeridge House. I have come to further revise my sense of British History. It has shone a light on the Slave Trade and the tangible wealth it concentrated on several notable families and the legacies left to this present day. Growing up in the 1960’s and 1970’s, my knowledge of History was shaped by the lights of the time, as indeed is each generation. Books, memorials, films and meeting people caught up in the afterglow of The British Empire entertained and fascinated me during my formative years. It still holds an interest for me, even if it has been long tempered by an awareness of its brutality and subjugation. However, that does not stop me gazing upon the memorials found in churches and cathedrals, that bear witness to former parishioners who served in some capacity during this imperial past. I wonder at their fate and the lives they led. The same might be said for their motivation. Old books I have about the house, all of which I still find quaintly anachronistic give voice to some (though not all) of the attitudes of the time. Case in hand, my worn copy of “Round the Empire. For the use of schools” by George R. Parkin (1892), “and it is on the character of each child that grows into manhood within British limits that the future of our Empire rests”; complete with a map of the world with the red colour of each colony or dominion. This earnest exhortation towards the perceived nobility of the Empire and the need for Patriotism may well have been part of the motivation for those who went abroad in service to colonies. Books, such as these, may have instilled such sentiments, but now very much run against the grain of thinking today. In recent years, there has been an attempt, amongst many controversial issues connected to the slave trade, to look more closely at the hidden legacy of slavery in terms of our landscape. Up until now, I was largely ignorant of the legacy of slavery in Devon, but Stuckeridge House along with other examples along the Exe, has given me much to think about.  </p>
                    <p>Stuckeridge House (1820) was bought by the Daniel Family, whose fortunes were founded on the slave plantations of St James, Barbados and Demerara. In addition to having their land confiscated, the indigenous people in these islands, were also enslaved along with countless Africans seized and deported, for use as forced labour and often under brutal conditions. The language used in various petitions arising out of court cases reveals how slaves were seen as commodities and assets and nowhere more was this evident than when it came to The Emancipation Act of 1848. Seen as a landmark legislation in banning The Slave Trade, it included compensation to slave plantation owners arising out of any losses they might incur. Thomas Daniel (1730-1802) whose Bristol based merchant company had clearly prospered, presented the loss of slave labour as part of the overall estate and personal fiefdom. In doing so, he received a quarter of a million pounds in compensation, a sizable chunk out of the twenty million pounds set aside for this purpose by the government. Thomas Daniel and his Wife, Eleanor appear to have spent time in Barbados overseeing the 364-acre estate with its 192 slaves. With them was their son, Thomas Daniel (1762-1854) and this may have served young Thomas well, as on the death of his Father, he was bequeathed the plantations. His younger Brother John received the not inconsiderable sum of five thousand pounds (48).</p>
                    <p>Thomas Daniel (Junior) became known as ‘The King of Bristol’ and attained the trappings of such civic positions as Mayor and Alderman and acted as Treasurer to two educational institutions. Thomas had a son, whom he helpfully decided to call Thomas and it was this, Thomas Daniel (1798-1872) who, with his Wife, Augusta Louise Bridges bought Stuckeridge House. They also bought nearby Stoodleigh Court in 1836 (See Chapter Nine) perhaps with intention of living there, but it is likely they spent most of their time overseeing their West Indies Plantations (49). The purchase of Stuckeridge House was for their eldest son, Thomas Daniel (1823-1862) and from 1847 he is listed in the census. His marriage to a local woman, Dorothea (nee Carew) from Bickleigh, put down some roots in the West Country and produced four children. We will return shortly to the person of Thomas Carew Daniel (1848-1923) when we reach Iron Bridge which is a little further on in the journey.</p>
                    <p>Stuckeridge House was the former home of Arthur George Llewellyn MC and in 1981, High Sheriff of Devon. His descendants run the house and estate as a corporate entertainment business specialising in shoots that operate between October and January. Judging by the amount of food on offer, it seems to me that any hunter will be kept pretty busy tucking into the "Aga produced feasts”, along with outdoor meals catered for by a specially modified land rover. The menu includes Venison, Pheasant, ham pies, Sicilian style salads, Duck burgers, Scotch Quails eggs, pheasant guenons, rabbit and venison rillettes. And all washed down with wines and spirits so that when a "bouquet of pheasants" (who coined that phrase?) obligingly comes into view there may be more pressing needs than letting off a few cartridges.  </p>

                    <p>The journey continued with a walk along a long stretch of steep sided wooded hills that offered considerable shade. Even with the prolonged dry weather, there was a vast store of moisture beneath the thick leaf litter and held within fallen trees carpeted by moss. The woodland floor was host to the tougher mob of bramble, bracken and nettles, but for colour and spectacle you could do no better than the range of fungi and lichens spread across decaying stumps of wood. The process of decay and regeneration helps ensure a sustainability of the woodland environment and viewed up close can provide a glimpse into countless micro- worlds. Each fallen tree becomes a host to mosses, lichens and fungi and insect life. Moss and liverwort, two plants of primitive form, co-exist along saturated swollen branches in thick clumps, absorbing the moisture from the atmosphere and protected by waxy coating to reduce water loss. Perhaps the most dramatic discoveries were the Fairy Ink-caps. In dark masses of caps, pale and blackening, they stood menacingly in appearance at the base of some logs like an army awaiting an attack with their shields raised. I found the occasional large solitary Fly Ageria with its large red capped surface pitted with white spots forbidding. And not without some reason as they are poisonous. There were Scarlet Elf Cups or Fairies' Baths with their small cup shaped to saucer, brilliantly scarlet red stood in stark contrast to the rather eerie looking Jelly Ear, which appears distinctly human-like presenting a tan brown wrinkled appearance. Whatever, their appearance, we could learn much from the cooperation between lichens and fungus (two separate organisms) which have evolved a mutually beneficial way of feeding and providing shelter to one another in exchange. They repay the woodland by replenishing the soil with nutrients and clean air. The moisture was also held in the ground, shielded from the sun and here the going was decidedly muddy and slippery. It made it more difficult to traverse the slopes and slowed our pace considerably. At times like this, it was not lost on either of us, the relative ease and efficiency, footpaths and bridges provide. The time spent trying to find good footholds meant it took much longer to travel a short distance and the effort more exacting. By comparison, where a lane or road or a clear direct path became available, we made good progress. This was the case as we emerged seamlessly out of Holmingham Wood and passed strips of woodland staked out with signs for Iron Mill Wood and Steart Wood. At the base of these strips, the owners had assembled sheds as woodland retreat. One habitation in particular stood out in the form of a caravan covered over with camouflage netting and a pet’s kennel to the side and the scene of being closed up until an opportunity arrived for the owner and their dog to return from wherever to their haven in the woodland.</p>

                    <p>Unseen by us, but across the river, lies the old farmhouse of Duvale Barton, or Priory, as it has been re-named since 1991. I made an attempt, a year later to call on the owner, but found her out. The farmhouse stands at the centre of what I took to be holiday lets and a venue setting set amongst the former out-buildings, kennels and stables. The kennels were built in 1919, by the Yandle Family, who took over the running of the farm in 1890 and were involved with the Tiverton Staghounds and in fact, continue to this day. The family no longer own the former farm, having sold up in the 1960’s. A fine stone statue of a half woman, half lion watched my approach down the drive as we made our way to the front door. The place appeared deserted in a way, I doubt would have been the case, when it had a large waterwheel and was a busy farm. A wall bore the date “July 1598” and is reputedly said to have belonged to Bampton Church (33). There is a suggestion that the name of the former farm signified it as being in “a valley of water”, which seems entirely apt, given its location. Someone, who was inspired to paint the valley was the Reverend John Swete (1752-1821), who was both born and buried at Kenton, one of the delightful villages visited later on this walk. (see Chapter 16).  He inherited wealth, allowing him to concentrate his passion for a thirst for knowledge, as his memorial at the parish church bears witness. From 1789, he toured around Devon, producing twenty volumes of water-colour sketches of the county, including The Valley of Exe at Duvale and another of a nearby quarry. Accompanied by a servant, he would tour on horseback, making preliminary drawings and notes of places of interest and then complete his drawings at his estate at Oxton House, Kenton.</p>

                    <BigImage src={Media.img30} />
                    <p>Charles and I arrived at Halfpenny Bridge. Its name is adopted from the toll charged for its use. It is no idle co-incidence that a toll bridge was built here; a fact well understood where toll bridges and roads are located along important trading routes. The pursuit of Trade lies at the heart of so many innovations that have shaped the landscape and reflected the human activity around the valley. In ancient times, or the Bronze and Iron Ages the ridgeways and tracks that followed the high ground and avoided the low-lying swampy areas and afforded views across the area to aid orientation. Many of these tracks still remain and have become incorporated into the road networks we use today and although the Romans did contribute roads, they were significantly less than the inter-village and towns networks that grew out of the Saxon and later Norman occupations. By the middle of the 14c many of the roads we use today existed then and have been subsequently extended, filled in and improved although the distribution over the county was uneven. For century’s pack-horses, carts, wagons and cattle drifts along with foot travellers would have filled these routes going about their business and no-where more so than the weekly market days at Bampton about a mile north east from Halfpenny Cottages and Halfpenny Bridge. Standing behind me was the farming land of Stoodleigh (approached from the interestingly named Dry Hill) and Loxbeare and Oakford (linked by the ominous Hangman's Hill) and access to the market at Bampton would have been important but required a bridge. Hence Ha'penny Bridge as it is known locally was an important crossing point and many of the bridges that cross Devon's rivers including The Exe have their origins from the 12c and 13c reflecting the growth of the trade in Devon.</p>
                    <p>From the 15c many formerly timbered bridges were replaced by the stone bridges seen today and benefitted from the monies raised by Indulgences issued by The Catholic Church as penitence for sins prior to the Reformation. The introduction of Turnpike Trusts from the 1750's went someway to improving some of the roads around Devon and Halfpenny Cottages and the little community that grew up around there would have seen plenty of traffic making its way over the bridge on their way to and from Bampton. The price of a halfpenny would have served to cover the expense for use of the other roads and bridges (including Exebridge from whence we had started our walk) within a 4-5-mile radius. By the 1890's the turnpikes system gradually gave way to the development of the Highways Board which began to improve the road surfaces and gradients and with the advent of railways spreading themselves across the valleys of Devon the passage of heavy freight and passenger service shifted towards the railways at the expense of the former horse drawn carriages and wagon services. That said the myriad network of bridleways, unmarked tracks, footpaths and lanes continued to provide access for many more isolated farms and hamlets, including the moorlands but those roads that now more formally existed remained very much the means by which carrier carts trundled along giving way eventually to the advent of the motor vehicle. </p>
                    <p>To my side, I have a copy of The King's England; Devon. Cradle of our Seamen and edited by Arthur Henry Mee (1875-1943), a Writer, Journalist and Educator and produced a number of books including The Children's Encyclopaedia and one title that is frankly priceless "Arthur Mee's talks to boys". Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of this but I do at least have a copy of my Mother's book, The Kings England, Devon. It forms a sizable tome lying some two inches thick and bound in solid red; a present "from one Devonian to another" given to my Mother, then Pamela Martin, by Septimius Percy Snow on her 13th Birthday on August 30th 1951. She recalls him as a kindly horticulturalist with whom her Mother (my Grandmother Barbara Martin) was on good terms along with his Wife. They lived in a detached house on the Collaton Raleigh to Budleigh Road, South Devon and I look out for the house as I pass it on occasions. Mr Snow ran a garden nursery to the back of his house and it ran down towards the bank of the River Otter and Mum recalled times when she and some friends would cross the river and make their way up to the hilltop with a cluster of Scots Pines overlooking the estuary. The Scots Pine trees are still there and make a marvellous show. The book on Devon was part of a set of books covering the counties of England and has a patriotic sentimentality about it, particularly in its introduction written by Mee.  This reflected the times and harbingers of war; "We remember also that Devon was the only county with which Napoleon came face to face, and we may feel perhaps that it added to his bitter punishment to think that he had lost a land so fair as this".  I mention this, only because I visited the Saxon town of Bampton on an overcast February day in 2016 and I wanted to compare my impressions with the description Mee and his contributors.  The name of this old market town comes from the Saxon meaning of the farm of the dwellers by the pool and this may be accounted for its proximity with the confluence of The River Batherm and The River Exe. The Church (St. Michael and All Angels) gets a full mention of its features and longevity including that of the Vicars who served its congregations. On the day we visited the church was locked and I didn't about the tablet on the west wall with the inscription, "In memory of the clerk's son. Bless my little iiiii's. Here he lies. In a sad pickle. Killed by an icicle. In the year 1776".</p>

                    <p>In fact, my memory of Bampton is fairly fleeting. It was our starting point for a much earlier walk entitled ‘The Bampton Nott’s’ and took my friend, Chris and I across a sodden landscape to Morebath and in particular the beautiful country church of St. George. Here we stopped for lunch in the front porch and gazed back at the fine deep country lane we had descended to the dismantled railway crossing, with its passing gates now entangled in ivy and the stony path that took us up to the village. The church was open which is always very welcome, but a reminder of the considerable problem with theft and damage although there is nothing new about this as the information leaflet pointed out. In November 1553, a thief managed to use a ladder to climb up onto the roof of the church and drawing the ladder up behind him, use this again to break into the bell tower and make his way down into the church whereupon he broke into the coffers and stole a small chalice and St Sidwell's silver shoe. (50).</p>
                    <BigImage src={Media.img32} />
                    <p>This latter item intrigued me and provides a glimpse into the iconography that was prevalent before the Reformation. It is hard to imagine today the importance of the parish church as integral to the disparate nature of modern-day rural communities but as Christianity spread throughout the England during the second century AD it gathered influence not only in the beliefs and physical manifestations of church buildings, crosses and lands but also in the rituals and traditions that bound communities together. (51). Much of this was expressed through the worship of symbols of their faith and St Sidwell was one such example. An Exeter Saint portrayed on a wall mount above one of the post-war shopping developments that stands along Sidwell Street in an area that bears her name; St. Sidwell holds in her left hand the scythe that cut her down and the cross that gave rise to her sainthood. In a story much like that with St Urith in Chittlehampton in North Devon, St Sidwell was put to death at the hands of her Step-mother and band of farm labourers. The legend goes that her head was cut off and where it fell a spring emerged from the ground but to add to the drama (and unlike St. Urith) she got up and picked up her head and placed it by the site that would become her shrine. The well (found near the junction of York Road and Oxford Road reputedly had healing powers for skin and eye troubles but has been sealed off since the 1870's. It is possible that the incumbent Sir Christopher Trychay came across St Sidwell during his stay in Exeter because taking up the priest position in Morebath he actively promoted her veneration in the local church having a statue of her placed on the alter. Like other saints she became the object of pilgrimage (not only in Devon but further afield) and increasingly adorned as a valued icon in the community and its rituals. A behest by Eleanor Nichol in 1529 of a silver cross and ring were melted down to create a shoe for the saint and placed on her feet (50). The loss of these shoes along with the chalice struck at the heart of the community and they gathered together to replace the chalice but even as this was happening the events of the Reformation were beginning to unfold and would wreak far more damage on St George and many of those around the county than the loss of the silver shoes could have foretold.</p>

                    <p>It was an overcast day when Chris and I returned to Bampton, having all but completed The Bamptons Knotts. That is all bar climbing up to the earth mound mote castle besieged by King Stephen in 1135 against the errant rebel Robert Douai which resulted from a dispute over lands and spread to open rebellion by the aggrieved Robert. Surrounded the rebel’s morale began to disintegrate and particularly when one of them was caught by the Kings soldiers trying to escape and was hung in front of the rebels. Whilst his supporters surrendered Robert escaped and little if anything is known of him although a suggestion made is that he met an unsavoury end. In summer the large trees and undergrowth that reside in the mound must cast shade and mask the view but on a wet February day there was no danger of any sunshine but the absence of leaves and recent clearance (not to mention hedge-laying- always a welcome sight) had laid much barer the view especially across the town below.  We made our way down Castle Grove towards the town centre and past one of the best antique shop frontages I think there is in the whole of Devon. Going by the name Chittles it has excelled in quirky displays each time I have passed it and no doubt is designed to catch the passing trade between the roads that mark the nearby intersection of much older tracks and trading routes. Like so many of the street scenes, however, the necessity of vehicles for so many inhabitants come at a price and it is rare to find streets that are not lined with cars and vans along their length and Bampton is but one of them. The effect is to lose something of the small detail and character of streets and buildings at eye level and detract from shop displays and in the case of Chittles it is a matter of pot luck if a view can be made when driving past. In my case I had been previously rewarded when driving by a good gap in parking to allow a glance at the shop display and so stopped in order to have a look around and walked out with an ornate fire grate so this time I knew what to look out for. The prosperity in the town generated by the former cloth industry and trade in cattle gave rise to the two fairs that took place in the town each year and the weekly market although this has declined to a one-day affair today although it remains a lively part of the town calendar.</p>

                    <p>Taking place in October each year the event boasts some 100 street stalls offering food from all over the world, crafts, and jewellery and accompanied by bell-ringing, processions, a local drama group; Bampton Mummers and Dave the dragon. The Georgian architecture with locally quarried stone and adorned by wizened wisteria climbers may well have influence on the display of the white horse atop a porch on a local pub. The White Horse (re-instated in August 1998) was the name given to many pubs as a sign of the Hanoverian Monarchs and the site taken as one example of the changes in the history of the town was at one time a complex of 16c cottages and the left side not originally part of the hotel at all but a shoe shop and later pawn shop before being incorporated into the hospitality business, not that this was straightforward serving as a magistrates court and posting office; all of which shows that the modern trend for diversification is in fact nothing new at all. Brook Street is also where I found a butcher and a fruit and vegetable shop with local produce and friendly service and laden with far more than I planned to buy, Chris and I made our way towards Fore Street and its Pharmacy with preserved sign advertising Chemist Tobacconist in stained glass window covering and up a footpath that led up to the church. Not far from the church is the town car park and this filled in site was where the two platforms and the shed and line of the former Exe Valley Railway Line stopped to drop off or pick up passengers and goods including locally quarried stone.</p>

                    <p>Returning to the walk, found Charles and I, climbing over a gate close to Halfpenny Cottage and into a large sweep of a field sided by the wooded valley. Here, we passed what I imagine was once an old-style outdoor privy. Set apart from the cottages by the country lane sweeping its way up towards Stoodleigh and Rackenford, it stood a reasonable distance from the cottages and close to Elder trees. This may have been a clue as I have learnt that Elder trees can act as fly deterrents and often found close to privies. The hut was of a small stature, its frontage built of brick to give it a more respectable appearance, whilst the business end at the back was made of local stone. The hut was sheltered by an arched corrugated rust-red roof heavily laden with a thick canopy of honeysuckle, ivy, clumps of ferns and tangling bindweed. It’s worn wooden door and frame guarded by a wall of spiky thistles. No matter how tempted I was to have a closer inspection, the fact that I was wearing shorts that day put me off the effort. It certainly met some of the considerations that make for a good Devon Privies as described by Shan Toyne in her contribution to a series of books that celebrates the tradition and heritage these little treasures have occupied some little corner of our fair and green land (52). The hut offered a degree of privacy and shelter. Its door faced the cottages and the road meaning that the open-door view when seated would have been tricky but it may be that this allowed for the next user to spot it being used with the door closed. At the back of the hut was a large mound of earth which had been colonised by stinging nettles. There were two exit points for the pooh’s and the wee’s. A seven-foot hole was dug in the ground (which appears to have been the average depth in Devon) and as the waste gradually built up, one method of curbing the smell was to throw over it earth or ash from the fireplace. Given that there is a statistic that each person produces in a lifetime some 4 tonnes of excrement and 7,500 gallons of urine, just one person alone will account for the steady build-up of the pit below. If this hut was a former privy, it may well have served many people during its lifetime and as the level rose someone had the unenviable job of scooping or raking the stuff out and this is where the hole in the back of the hut may came into its own, as this was the point of exit. I couldn't get close enough to see (which might have been just as well) but it might account for the stinging nettles clearly enjoying the location, but it shouldn't be forgotten that human manure (or night soil) was once much valued in the cultivation of vegetables and other produce in the kitchen gardens of any farms and cottage dweller. There were also people employed to scoop out the muck and dispose of it often with the use of "a shittus scoop”, a wooden or metal receptacle for holding the stuff and horse and so-called "honey cart". </p>
                    <p>Another method of disposal was placing privies over small streams and on the map a small leat did pass closely by on its way to Holmingham Farm which is where we were headed. I must confess that up until now I have been pretty ignorant about the history of our toileting habits until I read Bill Bryson's potted history of the water closet (53). He wrote about the evolution from the open range to the communal shithouses and onto the industrially produced Thomas Crapper designs which gradually became more commonplace in dwellings during the late Victorian period and onwards up and down the land. Correspondingly as the nature of the countryside has evolved, so too have the improvements thought necessary for daily living including the introduction of modern bathroom and toilet facilities to replace what was either previously there or non-existent other than in some rudimentary form. The effect was the disappearance of these little treasures, or ending up in retirement. Some have fared rather better than others, becoming much cherished household features, storage places or retained for their original purpose and quiet contemplation. Others, including this one, may just be waiting to be re-discovered and in the meantime are gradually sinking into a glorious state of wild neglect.</p>

                    <p>Just beyond the former railway bridge marked now by a raised bank and steeped stone wall and buttress is the point where the River Batherm joins the Exe. The river was subdued by the recent dry spell and there were many dry stony patches to be found. The former bridge has long since been removed and on the far eastern side the only visible trace is the supporting wall below, made from locally quarried stone. On the side we stood, the bank of the wall was overflowing with the thick tendrils of ivy. We passed the bridge keeping to the side of the river and to our right, Holmingham Farm and the leat met us at the bend in the river. It was pleasing to see orchard trees planted in the meadow. Just before the weir, we clambered up onto a wall that protected the side of the former railway line and jumping down we picked up the delightful green lane that has long since taken its place. There remains evidence of the former mining industry found in the spoils and abandoned sheds spread about the place. Every now and then, a gap opened up through the thick undergrowth allowing a glimpse of the man-made sheared cliffs of the former Holmingham Quarry.  It is a powerful reminder of the impact of mining has had on the landscape and yet it also offers a transformative view of Nature reasserting itself. The nooks and crannies carved out by miners, now serve as nesting sites for peregrine falcons that also use the height to spy their prey below and make their swoop. The former quarry now serves as a wildlife haven relatively undisturbed by human activity today and I was reminded of the similar lost world effect that is situated between Seaton to Lyme Regis. Here a 5-mile long stretch of coastline and an area of some 800 acres acts as a similar sanctuary. I most certainly wouldn't have wanted to be near there on Christmas 1839, when a half mile stretches of coastline between Bindon and Dowlands broke away in a massive landslip and created a vast plateau below the newly formed cliff line. The Under-cliff walk has become part of a large wild reserve due to any subsequent development being stymied by the landscape’s instability and poor accessibility. It has given refuge to a wide variety of wildlife and is truly a walk worth making. </p>

                    <p>Eventually, we came to Cove railway bridge and poignantly, a view from the middle of its reach full of fond memories over a quarter of a century ago. Looking down towards the lower stretch of the river, I recalled this was the setting frequented by an old dear friend, Giles and myself when we discovered it was a great place to entertain the kids (and ourselves) on those long hot summer days. We would arrive at a little lay-by nearby to Cove Bridge (which lay a little further on from where we were standing now) and unload the cars and hopefully all the kids. And then shepherd them towards the nearby gate and then between us lift and pass the smaller children over the gate or steady the older ones ("I can do it" was a usual refrain) and then joining the kids as they excitedly ran across the wide-open field. We, of course were weighed down by all the provisions needed for the day; water, food, towels and the inflatable boat. These family outings took place in similar weather conditions to those we were enjoying on this walk. I was no less delighted to find welcome shade amongst the trees that line the high bank river bank. As then, the low water level also exposed numerous pebble beds offering a rich choice of stones to pick amongst and created little islands surrounded by shallow channels of water which were claimed as individual kingdoms. This enchanted bank played host to the noble pursuits of damming, fording, paddling and general river-combing. In other places where the water was deeper and faster or the pools slightly deeper, we would launch the boat with a child or two, and swim around supervising and enjoying the submersion. I have good memories of the pleasure of surveying the scene of our combined army of children, fully occupied and absorbed in the pleasure of messing about in the water.</p>

                    <p>The sweep of water and the line of trees along the high banks and occasional open spaces all seemed to evoke in me, the landscape conjured up the images drawn by Ernest H. Shepard for the enchanting book The Wind in the willows by Kenneth Grahame (1908). The map of the Wild Wood and surrounding country found in the inset of the book shows the location of the various places that feature in the book and whose names and visual interpretation create a dramatic effect and range of emotions. There is the Wild Wood with its hint of anarchy, disorder and menace with roving bands of brigand weasels and draw on the troubling emotions that dogged Toad, one of the central characters, at intervals, as he makes his disorderly way through the book. Then there is the more sedentary ambiance conjured up by the Osier Bed, a place where willow was harvested for basket making and the canal that joined the river near to the old ford. All the way through the landscape, the winding river flows. It just as much a character as any of the animals and humans in the story and the combination of the illustrations and the writing have a warmth and a charm that have continued to inspire my love of river swimming over the years. Toad Hall, New Iron Bridge Pan Island and the Wild Wood; all are places I have come across in different shades and guises over the years. And all I have tried to weave into the stories invented and told to my children over the years to match the places we have visited. There are echoes and childhood memories of my maternal Grandmother regaling tales of pirates and smugglers as we walked down by the Maer at Exmouth. Judging by a photo taken from those excursions to Cove in the early 1990’s, one of my sons, Benjamin looked decidedly unimpressed as I pulled him along in the river with the iron bridge behind us. The upset was similar to Ratty’s forlorn attempt to teach Mole how to row. I recall Ben similarly deciding that he didn’t need any lessons from me and rather like Mole met with a watery end with the net result. I should add, that Ben has gone onto be one of the most adventurous and outdoor members of my offspring and I am immensely proud of him.  </p>
                    <p>There is along this lovely stretch of river a sense of being apart from the "wide world" and perhaps it would be possible to imagine oneself transported to the idealised and fictional miniature landscape of Grahame and Shepard’s imagination. It's nice to escape into the world of imagination for a little bit at least especially when you're messing about in the water. And that was something I half did, whilst floating in the middle of the river. There was a fine view of the iron bridge just ahead of me and banks of the river rising up to join the thickly wooded valley sides. Charles has said this was one of his favourite swimming moments and so it was for me, enhanced by the evocation of happy memories. What wasn’t to like? Floating on my back in the water with my head turned towards the sky, freed momentarily of much weight and burden and relieved of the fierce heat of the day. The effect was liberating. Wild swimming at its best. Never has the book, Waterlog, spoken to me so clearly at that time. Deakin wrote, that when swimming, “you are in nature, part and parcel of it, in a far more complete and intense way than on dry land and your sense of the present is overwhelming. In wild water you are on equal terms with the animal world around you: in every sense, on the same level” (5). Stripped of all but our bathing shorts, unencumbered by our bags and belongings, we floated freely. There was laughter and delight. I was more aware of being in the moment, carried by the flow of the water downstream and the soothing sound of my arms and legs gently paddling in unison with the current. Then taking a deep breath and turning over, I arched myself into a shallow dive just below the surface of the water. Opening my eyes, there was the wonderous spectacle of shafts of sunlight permeating the cloudy water adding a theatrical effect to the respite this lovely location offered. This tiny little portion of the Earth's surface provided the platform for the warmth, calm and that joyous feeling of being held in the embrace of the water and union with the great outside.</p>

                    <p>Looking up to the tops of the cliff faces I could see the exposed head of the quarry and considered the inevitable noise and industry that marked its shaping. As I understand it, the mines in this area had been manually worked with iron stakes and sledgehammers. When this was insufficient, Gelignite was also used to break the grip of the rock and allow it to be more easily broken up and transported for further grounding. The resulting aggregate was used in the construction of roads, dams and during the Second World War, the runways for airfields at Winkleigh, Chivenor and Dunkeswell. In winter, the use of Gelignite was more restricted due to the damp and cold conditions and workmen would strap it to the side of their stoves in order to prepare it for use, only to find that on occasions their attempt to keep it warm and dry had proved too effective. The loss of their sheds and stoves must have been a considerable loss to quarry men who needed the comfort of both when staying near the quarry for nights on end. Fortunately, there was no danger of our getting cold on such a warm day and after drying ourselves and bagging up, we made our way down the former line to a farm gate with clear signs that the owner did not want anyone to enter the ground. However, we were leaving rather than wishing to enter and we clamoured over the gate and onto a small country lane. I like to think W.H. Hudson would have approved of this ramblers’ spirit, as like him, we never set out to do any more than walk as faithfully to the river as was either practical or permissible. And where the latter was concerned, judged that so long as we were not causing harm nor damage, we would set our course by the side of the river and take our chances. There was only one occasion throughout the entire walk where we were approached by a landowner (at least we assumed that he was!) and told we shouldn't be walking in his field and we duly obeyed without protest. Beyond that we always observed the spirit of the Countryside Code. The lane we now stood on offered a path down to the arching Cove Bridge and its toll cottage that has stood by its side since 1791. I have been past here on several occasions in the past and always thought it a delightful location. Set against the steep rise of High Wood and access to the quieter hinterland of the high ground of Stoodleigh and its neighbouring villages, hamlets and farms. It was therefore sad to see that the cottage had been stripped of its thatched roof in what appears to have been a desperate attempt to curb the damage caused by a recent fire. Several strips of now blackened roof beams remained, but they were all that stood between the exposed cottage and the elements. I discovered later, that the fire had occurred just a few weeks earlier, which wasn't surprising as there was still a strong smell of smoke emanating from the pores and sinews of the cottage and the mounds of smoked and burnt hay lying strewn about the entrance and the river bank nearby.</p>

                    <p>Walking somewhat sorrowfully back up the lane, in the direction of the village of Cove we passed over what would have been the road crossing for the former Exe Valley Railway line. One of the pedestrians passing gates remained and opposite the former Railwayman's house. His duty would have been to oversee the opening and shutting of the gate. It is only a guess, but I can quite see how a working life governed by timetables (and necessarily so) might have been rewarded in Retirement by colleagues with the gift of a clock. How did this go down? I wonder how many Retirement Clocks have eventually ended up on the shelves of charity and antique shops or for that matter, Recycling Centres. I am pleased to report that for my retirement present, I was given a fine reclining garden seat which sits happily (even sometimes with me on it) underneath an arching Thumbelina shrub and Elder Tree and offers a marvellous way to enjoy an early morning cup of tea or the cool of the late evening after a hot summer's day. The former railwayman’s house is now a private residence, but in its present form is still recognisable from old photos I subsequently found on a website (Exe Valley Railway). This is a wonderful tribute to the on-going appreciation for old railways and their enthusiasts. As I understand it the halt was created in 1923, using layers of aggregate (in plentiful supply locally) to make a raised platform and a year later this was replaced with a concrete raised platform and the addition of an iron shed with a pergola shaped roof to serve as waiting room to provide some comfort when the weather was inclement. Within the space of just 40 years of this little halt being opened, the use of the line was diminishing as road haulage and car ownership became more prevalent. After the Second World War, Holmingham Quarries fell into disuse and with the closure of the line in 1963, the iron shed and its pergola roof were dismantled and left on a neighbouring field, until train enthusiasts arranged to have it reassembled at Doniford Halt on the West Somerset Railway. As Charles and I, continued our walk, we came in sight of an old corn mill, set back from the road. At one time, the mill had come under the estate of Cove Manor. The mill is owned now, by an exceedingly hospitable couple, Sue and David. They invited us over to come and have a closer look at the former wheel house. It is in a derelict state now and draped with heavy carpets of ivy, that may well be holding the structure together at some level. It had the look of one of those ruined buildings much favoured by English Landscape artists of the late 18th and 19th century. The fine setting of the mill in this lovely part of Devon was put in dramatic contrast to their experience of a recent flood when the river Exe broke over the banks and flooded the neighbouring fields and rapidly filled the leat and created a swirling mass of water threatening to engulf the house. The intervention of the fire brigade had managed to prevent this from happening, but I had the impression that it had been a rude awakening for the couple. </p>
