                <p>On a fine April day, saw Charles and I set off from the car park at Exford, for the third leg of the walk. A footpath was conveniently nearby and led us quickly alongside the river. The sight of the sparkling water on this sunny morning spurred our high hopes, that we might be able to find somewhere suitable for a swim along this stretch of the walk. If such a welcome Eldorado spot could be found, it would be the first such opportunity we had for a dip in the river thus far. Nowhere, during the previous two walks, had presented a fathomable bit of water, nor had the conditions of the weather or time permitted. Our present route took us close to <b>Court Farm</b>, a name given to it, by the generations of the Court Family, who have lived and worked here. In their kitchen, inscribed in the plaster, is the name and date of a Thomas Fugars,1674. This is thought to be a reference to the legendary <b>Thomas “Tom" Faggus</b>, whose notoriety is very much imbued in the folklore of the area (33) and was immortalised in Blackmore’s “Lorna Doone”. Faggus was a Devonshire man, born into the former mining community of North Molton and with a respectable background as a landowner and blacksmith. He found himself embroiled in a legal case with the prominent land-owning Bampfylde Family. The case went against him and he was left penniless and ruined. His misery was further compounded when the Father of his Fiancé, Betsy Paramore of South Molton, broke off their engagement. Tom's despair turned into indignation, summed up by the words Blackmore gave him in Lorna Doone: "The world hath preyed on me like a wolf. God help me now to prey in the world" (8). In turning to a life of a highwayman, Tom was reputedly motivated to act as The Robin Hood of Exmoor, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. The author, Blackmore would have heard stories about Tom and described him as "a jovial soul, if ever there has been one; not making bones of little things, nor caring to seek evil. There was about him such a love of genuine human nature, that if a traveller said a good thing; he would give them back his purse again"(8). In this role, he appears to have enjoyed the bitter sweet encounter with his former Bampfylde adversary, whose dodgy dealings had resulted in Tom's misfortunes. Holding Bampfylde to ransom, the man soon offered his money and valuables, in return for his life. In words that showed Tom exacting sweet revenge, he said, “permit me the pleasure, sir of honouring the custom that a robber never robs a robber “(34). Blackmore gave Tom a happier ending with a Royal Pardon, to the one more commonly recorded. Legend has it, that Tom survived a number of close shaves, when pitted against those charge with capturing him and bringing him to Justice. Several of the villages where Charles and I passed have some claim to Tom's exploits, many of which involve escape from the hands of the law. Simonsbath was one such place, but my favourite story concerns the Long Bridge over The River Taw at Barnstaple.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Each time, I cross the bridge, the story of Tom's escape from this bridge comes to mind. Word had reached the local magistrates, that the highwayman was on horseback and making towards the town. Gathering a small militia, an ambush was planned, so that Tom would ride onto the bridge unimpeded, but as he made his way towards the centre of the bridge, the militia would close up on him and secure his capture. All appeared to be going well, as Tom, unaware of the danger, made his way across the bridge. It was only then, that the militia revealed themselves, blocking off both ends of the bridge. Realising the danger and seeing no way back nor forward, Faggus did something unexpected. Stirring his horse, Winnie, they mounted the wall of the bridge and plunged headlong forty feet into the muddy waters of The River Taw below. Miraculously, both highwayman and horse, survived the impact and managed to swim to the shore and from there make their getaway. Who knows, Tom may have made his way to the place we were about to set foot. It would have offered a highwayman a place to hide. Our footpath, now led us away from the river and up the higher ground in the direction of <b>Higher Combe</b>. However, at the first opportunity, we entered a field and dropped down to the river. It was a lovely stretch of meadowland with sight of Road Castle, an Iron Age fortification on a tall summit overlooking the Exe, on the opposite side of the valley.</p>

                <br />
                <p>For me, the valley at <b>Lyncombe Woods</b> turned out be, one of the most beautiful parts of the entire walk. It seemed very much in keeping with the serene nature of the valley, that we should come across a well-maintained longhouse at Lyncombe. There, a homestead farm, full of old-world charm stood. As we walked through the courtyard. I noticed logs were neatly stacked against the side of ancient barns, a well tilled vegetable patch, plant pots were filled with daffodils and crocus and behind a hedge, an orchard with spring buds forming. For all its rustic appearance, the area must have been busy passing point over the river at one time. The ancient hump-backed packhorse bridge, standing close to the farm, still offers passage in the direction of Road Castle and Road Hill Road beyond.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Our walk, however, did not require the crossing and took us instead, on through <b>Curr Cleave</b>.  The path became narrow at times hemmed in on one side by the steep slope and cut out quarries and on the other, by the river. Walking so close to the Exe, there was pleasant ambient sound of the water rushing by. It formed a nice accompaniment to the occasional birdsong. The morning sunlight bore through the winding avenue of willows and alder, creating dappled light on the woodland floor. Catkins were making their welcome appearance and on the banks of the path and river were the ornate presence of Marsh Marigolds, Bluebells, Greater Stitch-wort and a marvellous specimen of Cuckoo-pint.</p>

                <Header as="h1">Irene "Buster" Johnson.</Header>
                <p>The woodland slowly receded and the farmland of <b>West Nethercote</b>, with thick hedges enclosing its patchwork of ancient fields, now asserted themselves on the valley. Into view came the medieval farmhouse of West Nethercote, home from 1951 until the time of her death, of another extra-ordinary Exmoor woman, <b>Irene “Buster" Johnson. (1907-1987)</b>. She was born into a comparatively wealthy background, with a French Mother and English Father. From Versailles, in France, she went to Cheltenham Ladies College and from there gained a place at Oxford to study Russian and for good measure took up Judo. Aged twenty-nine, she married Osman Wilfred Kemal Johnson (1909-1992). Her Husband, affectionately known as “Johnny “, was a kindly man and formerly a coastal pilot commander at Braunton and it was his love of North Devon that led to the family coming down to Devon. Leaving behind, a life of domestic staff, theatre and Bridge parties, the couple moved to the farm in1951. They brought with them, four children and a van load of pigs and poultry. Buster kept a written account of the early life on the farm, recording the family struggles, hardships and successes. This formed the manuscript for a book, she never had published in her lifetime, but was remedied posthumously, by her Daughter, Birdie Johnson, who also produced the book: “Life Portraits of Exmoor” (22) with my good friend, Mark Rattenbury. Birdie Johnson spent her childhood on the farm, returned in adulthood and lived there until 2009. She remembers her Mother as a warm, affectionate and active person. These characteristics are revealed in her posthumous memoir, entitled, “Alas, Poor Johnny “, containing a great store of events and characters, that clearly left a strong affectionate impression on those who met her. Boris Johnson MP, her Grandson wrote a forward for the book. The farm appears to have been a vibrant place and a touchstone for the family and Buster and Johnny are remembered fondly. Boris Johnson recalls spending time there in his youth. He attended the village school at nearby Winsford and also recounts memories of his Grandmother “Granny Butter “as being mildly eccentric, adapting herself to a life without electricity, running water and cooking meals in the cow shed. Many of the characters in the book, were the couples long-line of canine friends, that commanded great affection and devotion. They arrived on the farm with Dalmatians, but then had a pair of Labradors, Leader and Minky. The latter used to chase bicycles, whilst Leader would go to Winsford a-courting and often returned with souvenirs of his visits to neighbouring farms and houses. This might include a shoe or a wellie. Johnny used to go to The Royal Oak in Winsford and for good measure, sit on the stool by the fireplace, with “Shebie “, one of a number of Jack Russell’s who lived at the farm, curled around the back of his neck for company.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Our path took us over a small stream fed by a spring a little way up <b>Lyncombe Hill</b> and past <b>East Nethercote</b> and on towards a bridge, that led to a footpath on the southerly side of the river. This route passed <b>The Warren</b> and here, the landscape changed with round topped hills and fewer trees. The shape and contours of the valley were revealed more clearly and gave emphasis for the Hawthorn trees that were dotted across its slopes. I particularly like trees that stand in splendid isolation, high up on the ridge or bank of a hill and are set against the skyline. There is something quite dramatic in this composition. Against the less populated landscape and open sky, the eye is drawn to the feature of the solitary tree. It takes on a dramatic character and a lonesome mood. I imagine the unseen deep root stock, that binds the tree to bedrock and soil below. In such an exposed situation, the tree has to cope with the full forces of the elements, without the protection of other trees. The Hawthorn, one of my favourite trees, is often adept at coping with this beleaguered situation. Its compact and tangled form seems to weather the harshest of winters. It acts as a sanctuary to birds and other small creatures, with its harvest of red berries food in hard-pressed months. Towards, human purpose, its sturdy shape, fast growth and prickly countenance make it an ideal hedging tree. Indeed, the Saxon name ”Haga”, for the Hawthorn fruit, was awarded to the word we now use to call a hedge. When seen in isolated exposed places, perhaps as a solitary survivor of a grubbed-out hedge or in a small enclave and allowed to grow, there is often a sloping shape, bent away from the prevailing winds. Where branches have been torn or broken, a gnarled grimacing appearance has formed around its trunk and stems and the tree can appear more vulnerable. In May, even the most pitiful specimen will offer clusters of white flowery blossom with pleasant scent. Not for nothing is the May Tree celebrated to herald the coming of summer. The red berries also present welcome colour to the advent of winter. Fiona Stafford (35) writes that Hawthorn trees can be the sites where legendary treasures have been hidden away in pots and following the Battle of Bosworth, the crown of England was reportedly found hanging from one of the branches of a Hawthorn Tree of its tender flowers. Charles and I found no such treasure.</p>

                <Header as="h1">Our first swim.</Header>
                <p>All the while, the question of a swim, became more pressing as the day was moving on and clouds had begun to ominously gather in the distance. We looked for somewhere reasonably enticing and deep enough to have a dip, but no-where seemed very accommodating. However, we settled on a rather inauspicious spot, somewhere midway between <b>Bye Common</b> on our side and a view of <b>Kemp's Wood</b> on the other. As I recall, the water was shallow and at best, we had a dip rather than a proper swim. Having doffed our swimming shorts, we clambered our way down the earthen bank, our legs and feet, trying to avoid contact with the sharp stones and prickly, stingy plants. Then stepping gingerly into the shallow water, each footstep had to be taken carefully, as in parts, it could be very slippery or sharp, or worse still, both. At the same time, the water was decidedly cold and standing in the water wasn't the object of the exercise. With little prospect of an open waterway, I took a short dip in a small pocket of water, following in the example of Charles. Honour had been served, but now came the hard part. I have long come to the conclusion, that getting out of a river is very much harder than getting in. You face the same obstacle course in reverse, only this time dripping wet and with a bit of an up-hill battle. Personally, I do not like having muddy feet, but that, along with a few scratches is part of the outdoor swimming experience. I like to say, that having made the plunge there is an immediate sense of well-being and in entirely favourable circumstances, this is usually the case. On the other hand, where conditions are less conducive on the NUTS Analysis, this well-being effect is interrupted or delayed by the need to get out and get warm and dry. Once this has been achieved, even, the most modest of splashes, offers the reward of a sense of accomplishment. It has, in its own humble way, been a celebration of life and living in the world. It has made a contribution to a day well-spent. I now keep in mind the short story, “The Swimmer “, by John Cheever (36). It was, in part, the inspiration for Roger Deakin's own swimming odyssey (5) and co-incidentally, something Charles had given to me on my retirement. Devon, is blessed with rivers. In fact, it has more rivers and springs than any other English county. Its borders, North and South, are coastline, offering a bounty of coves and beaches. In short, it is as good as habitat to the wild swimmer as any part of the country and likely to keep us pretty busy over the years! Perhaps, the words of John Cheever will suffice. “The day was lovely, and that he lived in a world so generously supplied with water seemed like a clemency, a beneficence”. (36). There was time, for lunch. There always is time for this, especially after a plunge in the water. It is one of the nice interludes of the day. A moment to reflect on the walk and as time has gone along, reminisce about previous walks. By now, It has also become a time for the customary enquiry as to what each of us had prepared. Sandwiches seem to be the common denominator, but after that, Charles seems to favour eggs with salad, whereas, I tend to go with cheese or vegetarian slice. Charles, makes a flask of tea, but I have noticed, he is always very pleased, when I offer him a cup full of milky coffee, made to my Paternal Grandmother, Evelyn Conridge’s specifications. I have also developed a way of making “home-made cakes “, that from their packaging, look to all extents and purposes as if they have been bought in a supermarket.</p>

                <br />
                <p>The small village of <b>Winsford</b> sits on the bend of the river. Surrounded by tall hills with a number of steep ancient lanes (Furzehill, Halse and Ash) descending their slopes and met by streams and rivers, Winsford is a watery place. It might even be called The Venice of Exmoor, necessitating no less than eight bridges and a ford to provide safe passage across the river and village. Three bridges offer crossings over The Exe. The first was an ancient packhorse bridge which stands near to the newer <b>Vicarage Bridge (1731)</b> and both stand at the northern approach to the village, and offers passage onto Exford Road. Vicarage Bridge is the one used now for traffic having been enlarged in 1928/9, whilst its older neighbour offers a pleasant footbridge now. The third bridge was our destination; <b>Exe Bridge</b> (1952), which would take us over the river to continue the walk to Bridgetown. Our route from our swimming spot at Bye Common, was quite a long one, covering scrubland with hills rising either side of us. At <b>Larcombe Foot</b>, the water from <b>Larcombe Brook</b> joined the Exe, and a small farm bridge serving to cross this stretch of the river was closed off and in need of repair. So, we remained on the southerly side of the river, following the footpath up to <b>Ash Lane</b> and in the direction of the village. A little further down this quiet country lane, we took what may well be one of the shortest footpaths in Britain. It passed through a pleasant front garden and up to one of the church gates. Devon has its fair share of these rights of access that have developed over the centuries. Many of them take you through churchyards, rows of cottages or farm courtyards. I think, there might be a book in the making here, to discover some of the oddest and shortest footpaths in the country. One thing is for sure. The time it has taken me to write this, was considerably longer than the time we took to walk this footpath. Put another way (although you'll have to time this for yourself), it took a little longer to walk down the path to the delightful <b>Parish Church of St Mary Magdalene</b>. The old timber door, its ancient timber encased in even older ironwork was a delight; worn and pitted and apparently always open to a village, it has served since Norman times. The roll call of past and present Rectors goes back to the 14th century. As the guide book stated, the church at Winsford, "speaks through stone, glass, wood and metal" and in the three stained glass windows in the east chancel, this was very much on show. The windows, beautifully fashioned and richly coloured. They pick out the cottages and rooftops of the village and the church, set against the rolling hills and broad blue sky. Intermingled with this are the contours of the moorland and farms, with wildlife displayed that make up the ancient landscape. In the distance <b>Winsford Hill</b> has some ancient monuments that add to the tapestry of the area. The pleasingly named <b>Devil's Punchbowl</b>, is a distinctive amphitheatre enclave, carved out of the ice-age. As valleys go, it has to be one of the best views. Its curving slopes are strewn with trees offering an intimate wooded sanctuary, in contrast to the open moorland above. At its base, a spring arises and gathers water to descend to Winn Brook, flowing down to the village that bears its name, or is this the other way around? Close to The Devils Punchbowl and Spire Cross is the <b>Caractacus Stone</b>. Of uncertain origin, it is believed to be some 6c ancestor tribute to CARAACI NEPU, the Briton King, who fought against The Romans and was captured and brought to Rome in chains. The natural forces that have assailed it over the centuries and worn the stone and the inscriptions. I confess, I could barely make out the inscription. The human hand has also damaged it. In 1890, a piece with the letter N was broken off, but found in 1919 and recemented into place. It was also reportedly damaged by a runaway cart and so it is perhaps, as well that it stands under its very own shelter, constructed in 1906. </p>

                <p>Leaving the church and resisting the temptation to close the door, Charles and I made our way into <b>Steep Lane</b> lined with some church-facing pretty cottages. On the other side, a more modern house with a garden displaying a miniature cricket team at play. We re-joined Ash Lane and almost immediately turned down a tiny little lane and over equally small packhorse bridge, which crosses <b>Winn Brook</b>. Here, we came across the village green and having made good progress and decided to pause a while. The nearby Royal Oak, obliged us with two pints of beer and we sat on one of the benches in the green and supped our beer as we ate our remaining sandwiches. I noticed a bench dedicated to the memory of Mick Orgill, Farrier and Freeman of the City of London. It had the words; “Exmoor- Here true Peace I found”. In such a lovely location, I could quite see why. I looked him up on the internet and discovered, he was a former Liveryman of the worshipful company of Farriers. The memorial seat was recognition from his Son-in-law David Harman, who had spent some time as an apprentice with Mick Orgill and gone onto become a Master Blacksmith himself. I had a look at David Harman's work and have come to a finer appreciation of the mastery of ironmongery, some of which, I imagine adorns the area.  </p>

                <p>These words were written about the “bit of country between the Exe and the Axe which is watered by the Clyst, the Otter and the Sid “. Much the same could be said about the Exe, which was another river, this renowned Naturalist explored. He wrote about it too. One of the great pleasures I have derived from these walks and subsequent research, has been the discovery of books, that bear witness to some of the rivers, Charles and I have undertaken. To date, we have completed the Exe, Teign, Dawlish Waters, Lemon, Sid, Bovey and Dart. More are planned. We have been joined by a very dear friend of mine, Mark Burnard, who has admirably taken his place alongside us. In addition, I have walked the Clyst with my friends, Tanya and Karl Nelson and Jamie Piggott. Walking along rivers is a very nice way to spend time with friends.</p>
                <p>I have the strong feeling, I would have liked Hudson. He may well have beaten me, to the concept of Bimbling, given that on his walks or with the aid of aid of a bicycle, he seldom had any set itinerary. He walked and then sat, until he decided how to proceed and was adept at knocking on a cottage door to ask for food and lodgings. It also appears he preferred solitary walks, although his writing includes descriptions of encounters with people, but in the main, I think he lived up to the spirit of Byron's poem taken from Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: ”There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, there is a rapture on the lonely shore, there is society, where none intrudes, By the deep Sea, and music in its roar. I love not Man the less, but Nature more “.</p>
                <Image src={img18} fluid rounded />
                <br />
                <p>Hudson wrote about his travels down the Exe, in his book, “Afoot in Britain “(1909) and I find his writing very engaging. I suspect, like me, he had a strong sentimental streak which resonates in his lyrical writing about the river, he described as “a beloved stream. Many rivers had I seen in my wanderings, but never one to compare with this visionary river, which yet existed and would be found and followed at last “. A reverence for his ancestor’s connection to the river played a part in his decision to follow the river, as indeed it did with me, Hudson writing: “My forefathers had dwelt for generations beside it, listening all their lives long to its music, and when left it they still loved it in exile and died at last with its music in their ears. Nor did the connection end there; their children and children's children doubtless had some inherited memory of it; or came I have to this feeling, which is sacred and drew me to it. We inherit not from our ancestors only, but through them, something, too, from the earth and place that knew them”. At the same time, he was not one to hold back from stating his frustrations with Hunting or the loss of common land: “Unfortunately, this is not easy in a country where running waters have been enclosed, which should be as free as the rain and sunshine to all and were once free, when England was England still, before landowners annexed them or stole the commons and shut up the footpaths and made it an offence for a man to go aside from the road to feel God's grass under his feet". For good measure, Hudson also had something to say about the motorcar, “Well, they have also got the road now, and cover and blind and choke us with its dust and insolently hoot-hoot at us. Out of the way, miserable crawlers, if you don't want to be smashed!"(37)</p>

                <br />
                <p>Overall, the walk down the Exe meant a very great deal to Hudson, writing that not only was he following the river, but also “a dream as well as a memory “. His resolve “to have it behind me and before me and at my side, following, leading, a beautiful silvery serpent that was my friend and companion” was very similar in spirit to our endeavour. Finding this book was a delightful connection to the past and a kindred spirit. I have sought to locate some parts of the walk with the places he wrote about. Winsford, is one such place. In his book, "Afoot in Britain", Hudson described the village as "that fragrant, cool, grey and green village, the home of immemorial peace, second to no English village in beauty". I am sure, in peak holiday times and on sunny weekends, the village can soon fill up with cars and people. I doubt, Hudson would have liked that, but it wasn't like that, on the day Charles and I visited the village. It was relatively quiet and almost devoid of people; to be seen at any rate. On both counts, I imagine, this would have been different in 1909, when the communal village life was more visible and noisier. More people would have been out and about, going about their daily business on the village green, shops, small businesses, the public houses and along the rows of tight-knit cottages. I dare say, that around its centre, in appearance, the village would not have looked so different. The war memorial, surrounded by granite bollards, on the other hand would not have been there until after The First World War and augured ill for the tight knit community in the next decade and beyond. It was past this memorial, that we now walked on the next leg of the walk.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Immediately across the road, I noticed a colourful poster in the sheltered bus stop. The <b>Dulverton Players</b>, were performing a comedy by Denise Deegan, entitled “Daisy pulls it off”. The story behind the play revolves around life in a 1920's Girls English boarding school. The main character, Daisy Meredith, attempts to overcome the prejudice of her poorer background. For good measure, she and her best friend, Trixie Martin (fine name) seek a missing fortune that might help the floundering finances of the school. They meet and overcome the everyday adversities of false accusations, rescuing former enemies and discovering that Daisy's long-lost Father has been wandering around the school! The poster illustration of a jolly hockey stick scene, reminded me of those old-style books and magazines of the early part of the last century. The William Brown books by Richmond Crompton and their wonderful illustrations by Thomas Henry are amongst my favourites. I have copies of Boys Own and Chums books from the 1920's and 1930's and copies of the magazine, “Read and Learn” from the 1960's and 70's. I find something very endearing about them. They are very much of their time and provide an interesting counterpoint to the values held today. It has provided the material an inspiration for the comedy play by Denise Deegan as a spoof on the kind of stories found in Girls book and comics of the same period. In much the same way, Michael Palin and Terry Jones, brilliantly attempted this in their popular Ripping Yarns series of the late 1970’s. I can certainly relate to some of the atmosphere found in these stories of the cloistered world of a boarder and chorister. My school was entirely male, the traditions and rituals of the cathedral deeply engrained over centuries. A strictly hierarchical order regulated by the ecclesiastic year governed our lives. My term life was bound within the triangle of the Cathedral, the school and the Boarding House. Within this, my daily routine was surrounded by the ancient walls of the Cathedral, lined with monuments and columns that gave me a strong sense of history and heritage. Down the cobbled pavement outside the Chapter House, we walked back to The Chantry, after choir duties. This was home, in the loosest sense of the word. For such a large four storied Victorian building, it appeared claustrophobic, except for the Common and Dining rooms. The upper two storeys were packed with dormitories and the house had a labyrinthine number of rooms all connected with a network of staircases and fire-escapes. This was the setting for some of my formative years and glimpsed through the pages of my pocket-sized Lett's Schoolboys Diary for 1972. My handwriting is just about legible, recording a year stuffed full of Evensong, Prep, Sports events and at times, feeling homesick.</p>

                <Header as="h1">Ernest Bevin (1881-1951).</Header>
                <p>Turning right onto Edbrooke lane, we walked a short distance until we reached West Howeton Lane, leading to Exe Bridge and our crossing of the river for the final part of this walk. In doing so, we left behind the cottage that bears the memorial as birthplace of Ernest Bevin. Orphaned at the age of eight, he went to stay with family in Morchard Bishop and there received limited education. He clearly had a strong work ethic which carried him through the years. At the age of eleven, he was working as a labourer and then moved to Bristol where he became a lorry driver. It was during this period, that his political views led him towards Socialism and he was a founding leader in one of the biggest Trade Unions, The Transport and General Workers Union. His ascendancy into the high office of Minister for Labour in the wartime co-coalition and then, Foreign Secretary in the post war Labour Government was achieved, through a powerful stature and force of personality. He oversaw some of the defining features of the post war period, in securing financial help from the USA, in the form of The Marshall Plan to help boost a depleted British economy. Bevin also assisted in the entry of the United Kingdom into NATO and championed an early Atomic Bomb deterrent policy. He also began the process of Britain's dismantling of the Empire, but it was his health that gave out in 1951 and had to let go of the reins of Government, reluctantly accepting a ceremonial role as Lord Privy Seal with the words, "I am neither a Lord, nor a Privy, nor a Seal". He died in April of the same year and his ashes buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

                <Header as="h1">Edbrooke House.</Header>
                <p>On crossing the bridge, a recreational ground with a pavilion and a couple of tennis courts came into view. We decided to try and navigate the river as best we could, but the layout of the hedges, ditches and small ponds made this a tricky proposition. Fortunately, we spied a gate on the rise of land and reaching this, decided to follow the lane to a footpath that lay a little further up from <b>West Howetown</b>. This actually had some advantages, as it took us past some interesting houses and offered panoramic views across to Winsford and the steep valley below. Howetown House was particularly grand, with an ornate iron double gate and I wondered if this could have been the work of local ironmongers. As we reached the top of the hill, the houses began to run out and the metalled lane came to an end. Either side of us was Edbrooke Wood and nearby a footpath, that took us back down into the valley and towards the river in the direction of Edbrooke Bridge. We passed through a ribbon of woodland and a few enclaves of former quarries cut into the side of the hill. The stone would, I guess, have been excavated for the building of <b>Edbrooke House</b> and the packhorse bridge. Unfortunately, the bridge was not open to the public and for that matter, receives no mention in my new-found Ancient Bridges book (19). So here is my modest update. I note from the Ordnance Survey map, that the bridge would have served as an important river crossing point and link to the major ridge route of Road Hill Road. The bridge, the house and stone-bordered gardens are set within a lovely valley and the flowing river. I can think of no better retreat. In times long gone, the area may well have been a far busier and industrious place with the passage of cattle, farm workers and goods making their way across the bridge. An interview recorded in 1994, with Frances "Fanny" Jenkins, provides a valuable insight into life of the community in the early part of the last century. Frances was born in 1913, at Edbrooke House, where her Parents, John and Annie Bale lived and worked along with her Grandparents. Their employers were the Lyddon Family, who had owned the estate for some 200 years. Francis recalled her Grandparents working as cook and stable boy and the family becoming tenant farmers. Francis recalled a time, when many of the local families were connected generations of living and working in the valley. The estate provided housing and employment through its tenant farms, forestry, and domestic duties. There were also strong social bonds between the communities of Winsford, Exton and Bridgetown, all within this stretch of valley (38).</p>

                <br />
                <p>Unable to cross the river as we would have liked, we continued along the footpath which rounded the valley and led us out of the woodland into open fields beyond. Following the river as much as possible, we walked through a large expanse of meadow land. In the distance, was the bend in the river at Coppleham and the meeting of The <b>River Quarme</b> with The Exe. On the map, this slither of a river, rises from the various springs to be found around Wheddon Cross and follows the lie of the land close to the former Minehead Turnpike Road to Coppleham Cross. From there, the former turnpike road (now the A396) travels over <b>Coppleham Bridge</b>, a reinforced concrete structure (1926) and along the busy narrow road towards Bridgetown. We weren't that keen to walk along the road and continued until we saw ahead, a rough and ready farm bridge that crossed river and provided within a short distance, access to the footpath that skited through <b>Week Wood</b>, the site of a former quarry and onto the very nice Beatrice Potter sounding <b>Rabbit Wood</b>.  This confirmed the choice of route as the better option and took us through a pleasant woodland stretch, with the sight and the sounds of the river. Along, the way, we came across a large expansive weir nestling at the base of a steep rising stone wall.  It added a dramatic backdrop to the scene of surging frothing black water, pummelling its way over the weir. The water was divided into two currents. The lower course appeared noticeably slower than that of the upper course. Here, the water was forced upwards as it pressed against the unyielding side of the wall and funnelled furiously into the entrance of the leat. From here, the water flows down a channel towards the former corn mill at Bridgetown. In doing so, it runs parallel to the Exe and in the middle of these two water courses stands The Exe Caravan Park. We followed the length of this park, until we emerged from the woodland and stepped onto <b>Week Lane</b>. This marked our arrival at <b>Bridgetown</b>. Turning left, we walked over the narrow stone <b>Bridgetown Bridge</b> and in short step over the leat bridge noting that both watercourses unite just a short distance beyond. We stopped a while just to enjoy the view of the river before making our walk along the main road towards the layby close to the Bridgetown cricket grounds. I recall at the time, just as we were preparing for the journey back up to Exford to collect Charles’ car, seeing the carving of 1824 on the cliff wall across the road and wondering at what that signified. I thought to come back and find out more.</p>

                <p className="quote-credit">Rambles in Somerset“(1912).</p>
                <p>I need to jump ahead now, to a year or more after Charles and I had walked along this stretch of the river, out-of-sight of the village on the opposite side of the valley and hidden by the trees. On a warm late October morning, I was driving up the Exe Valley on the A396 with Kathy, my faithful companion. Taking a sharp right turn at <b>Machine Cross</b>, we followed the ancient ridgeway in the direction of Broad Lane Head. The tall dense golden-brown beech hedges positively glowed in the bright morning sunshine. Passing three finger posts emblazoned with the names; White Post, Combeshead Cross and Stolford Hill Cross, we reached <b>Broad Lane Head</b>. Turning into Broad Lane, we began our slow descent down the 1:4 drop, to the delightfully compact hamlet of Exton. If you want to get a measure of the panoramic views afforded by the 900 feet high Exton Hill, then going down is the best way. The views across the valley and the landscape beyond are impressive. Exton Hill dominates the area and upon its slopes, the settlements of Exton and Bridgetown are situated. A postcard dating back to the early 20c of the village suggests the village looks much the same as it does today. <b>Exton House</b>, the former Victorian Rectory for the parish (1871) is prominent in the picture. From the outside this expansive property is fronted with thickly fused dry-stone walls, that seem to fasten the house and gardens to the side of the steep slope. In days gone, by The Bridgetown Band would celebrate Bridgetown Club Day, by leading a procession of villagers up the steep rise of Exton Lane to St Peter’s Church. At the end of the service, the band led the procession onto the rectory lawn and then back to Bridgeton Meadow, where a fete would take place. Set into the lower end of the dry-stone wall was a red-letter box (GR) and close by across the entrance to <b>Red Deer Farm</b> stood an old red telephone box. I have no idea how long this little gem of a phone box has stood here, but it seems like it's been a while since anyone visited it. Opening its heavy metal door, cobwebs lay strewn about. A notice stated, that I had 42 days from 7/9/16 to express my opinion on the consultation process to have the phone kiosk removed. Well, that deadline has long-since passed and the phone still is in working order even if the exterior paintwork looks faded. Has it been forgotten or survived because in rural areas where mobile reception is poor, the decision has been made to leave the facility as it is? For the time being, the spiders appeared to be delighted with their home, although its lack of use must mean they are on the lean side for passing flies and moths. The nation has Sir Giles Gilbert Scott to thank for a design, that still has a foothold in the British landscape, despite their redundancy in many communities or replacement with newer boxes. In turn, I have reason to be grateful to Gavin Stamp for his little gem of a book on the subject of Phone Boxes (39). </p>

                <br />
                <p>They existed in small number from the early 1880’s onwards, but it was the Post Office taking control over much of the telephone service from 1912 that began to galvanise things. There were plans afoot, before The First World War intervened, to standardise the telephone service and this included the design of telephone kiosks. A competition was instigated in 1924 and the K2 red phone box (as it became known) was the winning design. Sir Giles Gilbert Scott managed to combine an eye pleasing classical look, within the price set for each one, not costing more than £40 to produce. Scott apparently recommended it be painted silver on the exterior and a greenish blue inside, but red (which had been the Post Office’s original choice of colour) was adopted instead. By 1934, some 1700 had been produced. Some even were exported as far as Bombay dockyard. Over the next five decades, new models were introduced meaning some of the older boxes were replaced or overlooked. However, with the advent of British Telecom in the mid- 1980’s, saw an era, where the numbers of red phone boxes went into decline. The advent of mobile phones and other technologies have also added to the overall decline, although there have been attempts to retain them. They are often found to serve as community libraries (e.g. Henock, Teign Valley) or Information centres (Plymtree, East Devon) or in the case of Exton as havens for Spiders.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Exton House marks the centre of this small hamlet and it’s easy to question how such a parish could have supported such a large rectory. The answer lies in the church of St Peter, serving neighbouring Bridgetown as well. In former days, attendance and patronage was more fulsome. <b>St Peter’s church</b> lies just a short distance from the former rectory. Kathy and I chose to walk along Lype Lane in order to visit the church. This took us past a cluster of older quarryman’s cottages and a holiday Cottage (“<b>The Malt House</b>”), formerly The Hare and Hounds. I noticed a derelict old cottage, thick stone walled, lime plastered with a broken pane of window glass. It appeared abandoned and I tried the latch on the old wooden door. Unsurprisingly, it was locked, but I peered through the hole in the broken pane of glass into the damp grey green mouldy interior. The walls were mouldy and an old coked iron range stood rusting in the fireplace. On the Google street view from March 2010, shows this rather quaint old cottage with a bicycle parked outside its front. The picture shows the same corrugated iron roof and an air of neglect and abandon about the cottage. There were hopeful signs of renovation work and maybe the cottage will be made habitable again. Behind the cottage, a path led up to the small wooden lych gate erected to mark the Millennium. It may well signify the achievement of its small congregation had in securing funds to make urgent repairs on this impressive 13c church.</p>

                <br />
                <p>It was through this gate; Kathy and I entered the churchyard and immediately my eye was drawn to the medieval standing cross. These crosses were commonly used for religious ceremonies in the past and where the former curate Oliver Bromley, stood preaching against the break with Rome. His fate was to be imprisoned in August 1535 (21). Oliver Bromley, for his sins or his conscience, must have been known to Will Moyne, who held the post of village Priest between 1520-1588, a not inconsiderable achievement of 68 years’ service. However, on the roll call of incumbents going back to 1314, Jobes de Clyff (1336-1460) at 124 years in the job, easily outlasted his two recorded predecessors and subsequent 30 successors. Two other roll calls spoke of the loss of villagers during The First World War. Included in this, were four members of The Boarden Family and five of the Quartley Family. Another memorial just above the pulpit recorded Major Charles Richard Thomas, MA, just 31 years of age when he was killed in action leading men of The Somerset Light Infantry on the attack on Mont Pincon, Normandy August 6th 1944.</p>

                <br />
                <p>As it happened, we had arrived at the church just as the morning service had come to an end. I was greeted with a cheery welcome from Peter and Mary Le Coyte, which turned into an offer to call down to see them for a cup of coffee. Happily accepting this spontaneous and I imagine, characteristic hospitality, we arranged to meet up in a short while. In the meantime, Kathy and I went to see the views from the upper slope of the churchyard and then made our way along the upper lane in the direction of the rectory. This took us past a busy stream pouring through a hedge and under our path and into a neighbouring garden on its journey to the Exe below. Our walk also took in the former school and schoolhouse, both closed in 950 and now private residences. As we walked down Exton Lane, we noticed a couple of cyclists nervously making their way down the hill. One of the riders was looking distinctly ill-at-ease, “I can’t stop”, he anxiously called out to a motorist opening her door. We passed them later, as we made our way down this narrow, steep-sided and winding lane on our way to Bridgetown. Only this time the cyclists were making their way up the hill and their pace was noticeably much slower laborious.  </p>

                <Header as="h1">Bridgetown.</Header>
                <p>Parking up close to the village pub, The Badgers Holt, there is an interesting pixelated image of a badger’s head. It's quite an arresting sight. Up until 1970, the pub went by the name, The Rock Inn, a nod to the excavation necessary to clear a large clump of rock blocking the path towards Dulverton and Exebridge. In 1823, The Royal Enginees began work on blasting a large column of rock to make way for the toll road leading from Tiverton to Minehead. Work was finally completed in 1824, marked by an inscription on the cliff face just opposite the Cricket Ground lay-by. Mystery solved. Before the opening up of this route, travellers on foot or with horse would have used a rough track running down by the side of the pub. They would then have crossed the river at the leat and river bridge along Week Lane (known locally as Wick Lane). The former forge stands close to the bridge and presumably made a reasonable income from the passing trade. No doubt, business only increased with the gradual improvements to the toll road, which opened in 1813. Much of Devon, remained untouched by the advent of Turnpike Roads in the mid 18c, but where they did exist, they made it possible for wheeled transport. The packhorse had for centuries, borne the burden of transport in the harsh conditions of the old system of routes. Travelling around The Exe Valley you can still see many of the Toll lodges that served these roads including a fine example near Exebridge (40).  I have little doubt that the road was important in developing the viability of the village as a working community, rather than a primarily residential setting. There remains the evidence in buildings, records and photographs of corn and saw mills, wheelwrights, mining and quarrying. The traffic of people, pack-horse, carts and carriages provided passing trade to the village and a link to the out-lying farms and hamlets. Today, motor vehicles of all shapes and sizes are the main traffic along this stretch of road. The wheeled horse-driven transport and roving cattle has long since given way to the motor vehicle. The road has done much to shape the landscape, economy and the lives of those living in the community. The road can be busy, except it seemed on this calm Sunday morning, which seemed to offer a truce where traffic was concerned.</p>

                <p>Our walk up the spine of the village was all the more enjoyable for this. It meant that I was able to chat to Joanne, who was out watering her front flower border. She told me she had lived in her cottage for the past year. Next to her was Riverview Cottage, which was a casualty of the fierce gales that hit the South West in April 2001. Joanne showed us the leat that runs by the side of Riverview Cottage. In former times, the leat had served the now defunct sawmill in <b>Bridgetown Wood</b> and still flows down to the Exe. On the day we stood by it, the sound was noticeable, but not in any way intimidating. By contrast, on the day of the storm, a tree blown over by the winds fell onto the leat causing the water level to rise dramatically. The water spilled out engulfing the downstairs’ rooms of the cottage. Work has taken place to remedy this situation, which is of some comfort to <b>Peter</b> and <b>Mary Le Coyte</b> who live in the old post office directly across from Riverview Cottage. The leat passes underneath their front garden and the house itself. The choice of Bridgetown, as a place to retire, was inspired by a mutual appreciation for Exmoor and the requirement that the home must provide space for both of them to pursue their interests. The couple moved to the house, fifteen years ago. The old Post Office has served as a former village Garage and a Petrol station, giving some indication as to how big the property is. It certainly has fitted the bill for providing Mary with her own jewellery workshop and Peter’s engineering workshop. Peter’s passion for flying Tiger Moths and Mary’s accompanying him on their foreign trips are recalled on numerous photographs as you enter the house. With flying expeditions now behind him, Peter’s current project has been constructing miniature steam 5-inch gauge locomotive (“not a train”) for The Taunton Model Engineering Society. “It’ll pull a ton”, said Peter, as he showed me around his workshop with the original sliding garage door. Everywhere I looked, there was something to catch the eye. Models of planes hung from the ceiling, a home-made sand-blasting machine, that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a laboratory sat on a worktop. On every available space sat a lifetime of tools and machines, all testament to Peter’s enthusiasm for making things. Mary discovered rather later than she would have wished, a passion for making things. Jewellery, has become a passion, but it has to fit in with her busy role as Lay Reader. She works as part of a team ministry which covers eight rural churches, spread over an area one hundred square miles. Mary, has a background in church social development work and Peter, a retired Dentist, have clearly have lost nothing of their zest for life as we discovered when invited to have a cup of coffee in the kitchen of their home.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Mary showed us a selection of old photographs of the village, which gave some idea how busy the community was at one time. Peter and Mary’s home bears witness to this having seen a number of transformations over the years. Today, it is a home, but in the past the house was used as a wheelwright using the leat for its waterwheel. In time, this became the village Post Office, store and garage/filling station. The only shop in the village is that now open and only seasonally at that, is situated at the nearby Exe Valley Caravan Park. Otherwise, a trip to Dulverton is necessary for the nearest shopping destination. In the past the village also supported a forge, a Wesleyan Chapel and cottage (1848-1968) situated in Week Lane, school, and several mills. Now these have been turned into homes. The community has changed too. I met Janette Allen, a few doors down from Peter and Mary, who unlike many in the village, lives in the house she was brought up in. The fact that she had been able to buy the house from her Mother had enabled her to stay. For many of her contemparies, the house prices make this prohibitive. There were fewer children living in the village and this had been one of the main reasons why the school had closed. She recalled how as a child, she and other children used to play on the road and visited the local store. Her main concern now, was the speed of motorists driving through the village which on such a narrow stretch of road must be unsettling. It struck me that in the short distance, Kathy and I, had walked, and aided by the absence of traffic, we had stopped to chat to a couple of villagers by the fronts of their houses.</p>

                <p>We now made our way to Bridgetown Grist Mill to meet with the owners, Paul and Cristine Matthews. The first impression of <b>Bridgetown Grist Mill</b> is of a commanding sight. It stands four stories high and spread over a large area of floor space and also over a leat. One of the previous mill owners used to fish for Brown Trout through a gap in the floor, overlooking the leat running below. It is a place that lends itself to ingenuity. Paul and Christine took over the mill, as part of the purchase of <b>The Exe Caravan Park</b> when they retired 15 years ago. It has proved an active retirement as far as the renovation of the formerly derelict mill was concerned. Together, they have run a successful caravan park with many people drawn by an interest in the mill and the proximity of the moors and countryside. Christine had visited Exmoor as a child and harboured a strong affection for the area and it was one of the reasons they moved to Bridgetown. Paul gave us a tour of the mill, beginning with the splendid waterwheel. This had been one of the main renovation projects and perhaps, the one that has produced the finest rewards. With a couple of helpers, including a former mill worker from Dulverton, Paul set about restoring the wheel to work. Everything had seemingly been repaired and set for the moment the sluice gate would be opened and water allowed to surge in to turn the wheel. In the event nothing happened. Not so much as a stutter or shift. The three men clambered onto the wheel and began to jump up and down. The wheel suddenly burst into life and began to turn rapidly and Paul remembers that the men, including himself, were able to jump off in time.</p>

                <p>Inside the lower section of the mill is the control centre of the operation. To the uninitiated, the space is occupied by a large framework of iron and wood. It is a mass of huge wooden beams, interconnected with a labyrinthine of metal turn wheels, frames, ropes, pulleys and chains. Despite Paul's attempt to educate me as to the workings of this impressive bit of kit, I came only fractionally the wiser. It was nonetheless, instructive and interesting. All this elaborate machinery, allows a single person to harness the power of the water, and to do this, requires a working knowledge and good pair of hands. Paul’s experience made the task of setting the machine in operation look simple. The turn of a handle, pull of a lever or ratcheting up a chain began to invigorate the dormant structure. With each turn or twist, there came the groaning, gnawing sound of motion and activity. Slowly, the whole space began to reverberate with the sound of a watermill going about its business of “grist to the mill “, as the expression goes. The grinding the corn and wheat has been central to the former life of the mill and with it, the use of large mill stones. The mill used imported mill stones from France that produced a finer flour. These circular stones were on full display in the sitting room. One was still operable and revolving as we saw in the first floor sitting room. It stands (or revolves) as a feature now alongside another wheel, that is now out-of-action. At the top of the mill, there is a colony of Bats protected by law and viewed on a webcam set up in the control room, to observe them.</p>

                <p>At one time, Bridgetown Mill was the largest mill around Exmoor and has a history that probably goes way back beyond its recorded 400-year history. Paul showed me several photographs recording the mill in its former working life, including The Phillips Family assembled in their Sunday Best dresses and suits. The family owned the mill during the 19c and developed the business, to include specialism in machines, wheelwright, carpentry and smithy and were an important employer locally. The mill operated until 1947, but retains an important link with the past industry of the area. The overhanging roof which is still evident on the building. This provided cover from the rain for the passing carts and wagons delivering or collecting sacks of corn or flour. Two large mill stones stand roadside leaning against the mill serve as a reminder to its past. There were three photographs that I found particularly poignant. A gentleman, in late age, made a return visit to the mill and the village he been sent to, as a wartime evacuee. He later sent Paul and Christine, photographs of his time there. It had clearly been a happy time for him during the war years. Likewise, for us, Kathy and I, left with a nice collection of memories from our visit to the mill.</p>

                <p>Just across the road, but set up a little higher on the slope is <b>The Exton and Bridgetown Village Hall</b> which has been going for over 100-years on its present site. The hall was reconstituted from a military hospital at an army camp outside of Minehead in 1907 and has benefitted from a communal effort in addressing its former wear and tear.  At one time, electricity generated by the mill was used to provide light for the hall and no doubt came in handy for the former reading room. From the noticeboard there appeared to be a number of activities and notices (often a barometer to the communal health of a village) indicating that the communities are in good heart. Perhaps, the focal point of the village is <b>The Bridgetown Cricket Ground</b>. At the time, Charles and I had stopped there, we were impressed by its graceful appearance, particularly the club house, standing somewhat regally overlooking the grounds. It bears testament to Roy Nesfield, a Yorkshireman and keen Cricketer. In 1924, he founded the club, bringing to the village, a missionary enthusiasm for cricket. Nesfield appears to have been a keen Cricketer, having played for Worcestershire just after The First World War and determined thereafter, to remain involved in the game. Having had a house built in the village, he turned his attentions to instructing the villagers to the mysteries of the ancient sport of Cricket. They seem to have been willing converts. The village now has one of the nicest grounds in the country. This is a view widely shared. Foreign teams make their way to play on its favoured grounds. Nesfield’s gift of the thatched pavilion overlooking the ground, offers a splendid place to have a cup of tea on a boiler heated by gas bottles. The pavilion also is home to nesting swallows and Wrens. Perhaps, the greatest tribute to the ground, comes from Wisden, The Cricketing Bible. In 2002, it named the grounds as the loveliest in the country, a distinction it may well still deserve to this present day</p>
