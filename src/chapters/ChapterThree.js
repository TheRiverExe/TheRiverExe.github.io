                <p>It was over a pint or two, and one evening at The Royal Oak, St Thomas, that the idea of sharing the journey downwards from Exe Head to Exmouth crystallized into a plan of action. Perhaps, it was the spirit of the Exe, flowing beside the pub, that cast its spell on the occasion. It may also have been the spirit of Roger Deakin, author of “Waterlog “that played a part. My would-be companion was <b>Charles Dixon</b>. I don't recall how or when we came to discover our shared enjoyment of wild swimming, but I have much reason to be grateful to Charles. I was due to go on holiday to Harlyn Bay, on the north Cornwall coast and Charles recalled that one of the places, Roger Deakin mentioned in the book was <b>Treyarnon Bay</b>. It has a tidal rock pool par excellence and fortuitously was just a short distance from where we staying. Charles kindly loaned me his copy of the book and it proved to be something of an epiphany. Quite simply, I found the account of his various swimming adventures widening the narrow lens through which I seen wild swimming and opening up new vistas of swimming locations with inspirational evocations. As soon as I got home, I made my way to my nearest bookshop and purchased my very own copy. In the years, that have followed, the book has attained the status of a much-loved read. The covers are battered and frayed and inside, the pages have comments and notes scribbled. Pages are folded and their corners turned for ease of reference and photos and additional sheets of information stored. A plastic band holds the whole crumpled marvelousness together. The book has become something of a talisman to a small group of us, who share a love of the outdoor swimming. Serendipitously, at the time of meeting in the pub, Charles, had decided to drop a day per week in his work schedule and the idea of joining me in a walk along the Exe, with a series of swims, seemed a welcome opportunity. It has proved to be a good and valued partnership and one that has (at time of writing) led us to walk not only the Exe, but The Rivers' Teign, Lemon, Sid and Dawlish Waters. Into our walks, has come along one of my oldest and dearest friends, Mark Burnard. More walks are planned.</p>

                <p>All along, I knew that my camera would be never far from my side and a journal would arise out of the adventure. It seems to run in my family genes as a few old family albums bears witness. However, one in particular, caught my eye. It was compiled by my late Uncle Arthur Edwin James Conridge and seems to resonate with the spirit of our adventure, even if it differs in most other respects. I treasure the album, not least because it offers a glimpse into my Uncle as an earnest twenty-three-year-old young man, rather than the man in his sixties and seventies, as I recall him. He clearly took some trouble over it. The album contains thirteen pages of black and white photographs, each carefully positioned to allow space for his neatly written account (black ink) and held in place by four white corner staples stuck on the page. Each page offers an interesting insight into the two-week motorbike trip, leaving London and touring up to North Wales. Perhaps, I can do no better, than allow the words, my Uncle Arthur (I really cannot call him anything else) wrote to tell the story. It began, on Saturday June 28th 1931, when Uncle Arthur arranged to meet his friend Peter for the start of a motorbike tour of Wales. "The start, originally arranged for 11am, was delayed until after 2 pm. Trouble soon overtook us for after obtaining some petrol at Wood grange we missed each-other. As Peter was in front, I thought he would wait for me at Aldgate, but when I arrived, he was not there. Thinking that possibly he had gone on, I went to Shepherd's Bush. There, coming to the conclusion that somehow, I had passed him, I waited for him. At 3.45 pm, I took the bull by the horns and phoned home, and as luck was with us, he was there. We made definite plans to meet at Holland Park Hall. He turned up at 4.30pm. The photo shows <u>Him</u> arriving. We afterwards made definite arrangements where to meet each-other in the event of the same thing happening again but fortunately it did not".</p>

                <p>The road trip was further punctuated by what Uncle Arthur calls, “a series of unfortunate happenings “. At Whitney in Oxford, they spent their first night under canvas. Uncle Arthur recalls his shaving soap had fallen out of its tin and mixed with the cutlery. He says phlegmatically, it was "soon remedied" and the following day at Mumford Bridge, near Shrewsbury, another unfortunate happening was discovered. The toothpaste had become loose and got into the primus stove; the cheese had gone off and mixed with the cocoa to "form an alliance with the bacon and our supper consisted of baked beans, flavoured with soap, toothpaste and cocoa". The written account seems to peter out, by the time they arrived at Rhyl, "a very nice little town facing north" and the rest of the journey was accompanied solely by photographs of the places they visited with a simple caption.</p>
                <p>The rest of the album provides an inkling of his early courtship with Iva (Auntie Iva) Gladys Allen, his future Wife. There are photographs of meetings with her family who lived at the delightfully sounding, Little Tangley Cottage, in Wonersh, Surrey. The album also has a selection of photographs of a subsequent tour of the West country in July 1932. Here, Uncle Arthur and another friend, Mack, drove a Morgan car some ,100 miles, visiting Yeovil, Honiton and Liskeard. They also passed through Exeter and Truro, Portland and Lands’ End. My favourite entry concerns parts of the Exmoor landscape, I too, have travelled in the past few years more regularly. The Morgan, Uncle Arthur and Mack were driving sustained a puncture, “12 miles from Lynmouth and 12 miles from Porlock and 1- mile from Oare but der baint be no garage in Doone Country. N.B Morgan’s can go about 20 miles on flat tyre".</p>

                <p>Uncle Arthur served with The Royal Army Medical Corps in the late 1920's and transferred to the Army Reserves in January 1930 as a Warrant Officer Class I. By the end of 1932, he had taken up a clerical position at Mile End Hospital in London and subsequently went to work as a shipping clerk. He and Iva married in April 1939, but the advent of the Second World War (1939-1945), soon separated them. He re-enlisted with the Medical Corp and was one of those fortunate to have been rescued from Dunkirk in June 1940. He was subsequently sent out to serve in Accra, West Africa. In another album of photographs recording his time there, shows him in smart military attire "dressed for dinner" and travelling around the country recording the local inhabitants and the rich variety of landscapes, including the beaches, forests and small towns. The photos also record his comrades in arms, although it does not appear, he saw much military action. This came sure enough, when he was redeployed to Germany during the last few months of the war. He certainly witnessed some difficult experiences, judging by a few of the photos he took at the time near Nijmegen. A nearby abandoned tram took “a direct hit by a Jerry 88- no-one hurt". After the war, Uncle Arthur and Aunt Iva ran a General Stores shop in Peckham, London and Uncle Arthur worked as a clerk at The Baltic Wharf Timber Merchants way past the normal retirement age. Nonetheless, they were able to travel around the United Kingdom and Ireland in their beloved Rover Car and accompanied by their Aberdeen Angus dog and during the 1960's and 1970's I have fond memories of meeting with them and hence my inclusion of them in this book. </p>

                <p>It was a cold grey leaden day in February, arguably, not the most inviting time of the year, for the start of the walk. However, it offered the prospect of warmer months ahead and certainly an invigorating induction in the rawness of winter. Charles and I had decided to start from Goat's Hill Bridge and as a preamble, walk up to Pinkery Pond and there, have a baptismal swim. After this, we would saunter our way casually down to Exe Head and the source of the Exe. Having reached this point, we intended to make the short walk along the fledgling river to Exe Head Bridge as the official first part of the walk. The plan was to begin the second leg of the walk from the bridge and walk to Exford. It meant, of course, that we would only have walked a mile or so, of the river, but the choice was determined by the logistics and preference. Our route enabled us to take a circular route (often more desirable) taking in Pinkery Pond, The Chains and a detour towards Simonsbath. It sounded all so easy in the planning, but on the day, the prospects seemed decidedly more challenging. Parking at Goats Hill Bridge and gathering our things, the rain was falling and it was windy. This felt decidedly more like an expedition into the wild, rather than a sun-filled jaunt. We made our way up to Pinkery Pond along the track I had taken the previous year. Reaching the promontory overlooking the windswept pond, the NUTS analysis conclusively ruled out any notion of a dip. Our attention, now switched to navigating the mile or so long stretch to Exe Head. It says much to our spirits on the day, that Charles and I maintained some semblance of a conversation along this section of the walk. Perhaps, we were trying to keep each-others morale going. The ground was uneven, sodden and navigating a sure foot route, nigh on impossible. In short time, I had stepped into any number of boggy pockets and my boots and socks had become saturated. The wind and the rain also were coming towards us in a relentless manner. We followed the old estate wall until we reached <b>Exe Head</b>, a hallowed place now, in the memory of my last enjoyable visit. There was a real sense of pleasure in sharing this moment with Charles, because from the start, he had embraced the idea of this odyssey and here we stood at the beginning. Nowhere, more so, was I filled with the spirit of anticipation and adventure for what lay beyond. Charles drew a small stone from where the water was beginning to thinly pool and this, he announced would be the gift to the sea at the end of our journey.</p>

                <p>The valley of Exe Plain is where the infant river begins to take form. Rainfall and the waters emanating from this huge sponge find their way down the lowest course of the valley merging with the growing stream. Our intention from the start, was to try and follow as closely as possible, the course of the river. However, it pretty quickly became clear this was going to prove much more difficult than we anticipated. The stream flowing from the source, makes its steady descent into the wide-open valley of Exe Plain. We attempted to follow this, by stepping over the fence close to where the stream flowed underneath and headed downhill. The stream soon became almost indistinguishable from the reeds and grasses that carpet the boggy terrain. It was also very difficult to manoeuvre, because each step required a crude assessment of whether you might find something solid to stand on, or sink into one of deep sucking watery pockets. This made for faltering, laboured and slow progress. And all the while, we were trying to keep an eye out for the approximate direction of the stream. Just as a sighting of this came into view, it would be lost again under a dense carpet of soft rush. However, as we about half-way down the valley, the stream came more reliably into view. Here and there, it was possible to step across the stream and we came across our first bridge although this is a rather a grand description for a wooden plank. It, nonetheless, allowed access to a measuring pole to gauge the depth of the water. We were not far from Exe Head Bridge now and I stopped to look back up the valley. I contemplated the apt description William Atkins (7) used to describe the experience of walking on the "moor proper when the place is at once underfoot and on the horizon". In front of me were countless clumps of tussocks grasses forming thick pockets of miniature bleached haystacks. All were hostage to the winds that whipped up them up into rhythmic waves across the moorland or bent inert. Each surge of wind created a strong rustling sound through the valley. As the valley rounded Exe Head Bridge came into view along with a line of Beech Trees. Stepping through the gate and onto the Simonsbath to Lynton road, we could see that one of these mature trees had been uprooted and suspended over the bank on the opposite side of the road. For a time, we surveyed the view from the bridge. The absence of any traffic seemed to emphasis the loneliness of this spot, a theme reinforced by a sturdy yet solitary Rowan tree, it berries still clinging into its host. Below the bridge, the waters flowed freely and with purpose. On the sides of the outer wall of the bridge, lichen created a rust-brown colour to the stone. This would be the place we would return the second part of the journey. But, for now our attention was drawn towards the walk up to Simonsbath, but not before, Charles had secreted the stone in a hollow close to the side of the bridge in preparation to be retrieved for the next walk.</p>

                <p>From Exe Head Bridge, we followed the road in the direction of Simonsbath. This took us past the marvellous spectacle of the wide Cleave Valley, surely one of the best views to be had on Exmoor. As we ascended towards <b>Prayway Head</b>, we could look down the high slopes towering over the valley floor to the river below. This was to be the first part of our next walk and I looked forward to this. The landscape looked very impressive and starkly beautiful with thick coatings of grasses, in shades of browns and greens and all pitted against a featureless sky. Here and there, were lines of stone walling, wire fencing and old lines of Beech trees, drawn across the bold sweep of the landscape. Their diminutive appearance in the vast wilderness reminded me of the history in this area of trying to harness and subvert the land to human use and profit. The Royal Forests, once spread across the kingdom, included a vast estate spread around Simonsbath. In such open moorland, as existed at the time of its sale to James Boevey in 1651, the term Royal Forest might seem confusing. It was a term, used in older meaning to describe a tract of land set aside by law for the preservation of royal game. We get a better insight into the nature of the landscape from a survey conducted in advance of the sale. The estate was uninhabited and characterised by moorland and consisted of little more than a few rough tracks meeting at what was to become Simonsbath. It was the redoubtable, <b>James Boevey (1622-1696)</b>, of Dutch ancestry and a wealthy merchantman, who built the first substantial residence in 1654 and it remains there to this day. Simonsbath Lodge, may have changed considerably since his time, but it still commands the fine view of The River Barle and the valleys towards Flexbarrow and Cow Castle. From <b>Simonsbath Lodge</b>, he set about consolidating his position as Warden of the Forest, giving him powers to administer and profit from the rule of Forest Law, which governed these estates. In effect he operated a personal fiefdom overseeing grants, rent and conditions of use of the land and any breach of the law. One of the first initiatives he undertook, was to establish the first farm on the estate, on land enclosed between Ashcombe and Lime Combe, close to The River Barle. Not content with his own dominion, he attempted to extend his reach into land held by the Free Suiters, who owed ancient holdings on neighbouring pockets of land. He also sought to usurp the rights of commoners on the land. He seems to have been fairly ruthless and canny too, increasing the rent on land and when faced with boycotts, reducing the charge, but not its original level. His resort to lawsuits profited him with a judgement that he, as Warden, had the right to fix the rate at whatever level he saw fit. However, in 1660, with the Restoration of the Monarchy, the estate reverted back to Crown control and Boevey became a tenant. His enemies might well have had cause to celebrate, but Boevey was equal to the challenge. He was able to renegotiate a new lease at the old rate, below the value he might otherwise have been expected to pay. In effect, this meant he was able to make a tidy profit from the estate but the next ten years, appear to have also brought their fair share of troubles. He took action against seventeen farmers over pasturing dues and also became embroiled in litigation regarding his first Wife's Property in Holland. By 1670, Boevey was living in Cheam, Surrey, but languished in a Dutch prison between 1672 and 1674. The indomitable Boevey, with the benefit of influence in high circles, and possibly having secured both compensation of £30, 000 and his release, was back at Simonsbath and engaged in another legal claim. His case sought to extend the boundaries of his estate beyond the lands owned by the Free Suiters. He was unsuccessful and he came to Simonsbath, less frequently as the years progressed. With his death, the wardenship passed to his Widow, Margaret Cressant who managed the state for eight years (13).</p>

                <p>Reaching the top of <b>Great Ashcombe</b>, there is a beech-lined straight road that took us down a slow descent past the surviving legacies of James Boevey, the farm and towards Simonsbath Lodge. This was the only house complete with thirty-eight trees and five inhabitants, at the time (1818), <b>John Knight</b> bid successfully for the 10,262 acres of "wasteland" from the crown estate. The survey stated that the estate was largely unenclosed, given over to open moorland and used for grazing cattle. There was no timber, except for thirty-seven trees, including Ash, Beech, Sycamores and Lime Pollards. The house had fallen into decline with damage and neglect caused by the tenants and served as an Inn to passing travellers. John Knight (1765-1850) from The Castle Hotel in Lynton, set about trying to transform the estate in the hopes of replicating the success he had had in developing estates in Worcestershire. Simonsbath was intended by Knight, to become the "Capital of the moor". His first task (and one of the conditions of the sale) was to have the roads and enclosures established. The construction of the Exmoor Wall and planting of beeches undertaken by John Knight, spread over thirty miles in length and measured a uniform six feet high and six feet thick. They remain a prominent and attractive part of the landscape. The roads constructed followed the routes of former rough tracks and are noteworthy for the many straight courses they run across the moorlands. The road, we were walking down on our way down to the small hamlet is part of this legacy. At one time, it was a rough track used to drove cattle. The road subsequently established by the Knights with a later ambition that it become part of a link with a planned railway conveying minerals from the estate to the sea. It makes for a nice way to approach the hamlet and being a weekday, we hardly saw a car. Reaching a junction, our route was towards Challacombe, but nearby stood Simonsbath House (nee Lodge), now a popular hotel and overlooking The River Barle, now unleashed from its hold at the dam at Pinkery Pond. The name of Simonsbath that has developed around this ancient house, derives its name, in part from the old English word for water or pool. From 1830, Simonsbath Lodge was used by Knight for his own residence and centre of operations. There was a plan to build a mansion behind this. Work was started but the mansion never completed and what was built was pulled down in 1899. In the past couple of years, a project has begun to recover the Lost Gardens of <b>Simonsbath</b>, an area, the Knights began to have landscaped close to Ashcombe brook, which flows into the Barle. There is much work to be done, but the avenues of beech trees, plantings of rhododendrons and rock features provide some testimony to the ambitions of the family. On the site of the former school (closed in 1970) and more recently run as an Outward-Bound Centre, is some trace of the former house and by the side of Ashcombe Brook, what appears to have been an old ice house. The site is now boarded up and awaiting redevelopment by its new owners since 2013, The Exmoor National Park.</p>

                <p>I since returned to the hamlet to draw a little more perspective in the research for this book. However, Charles and I did not explore the hamlet, but turned instead towards Challacombe. We passed <b>West Cottages</b> and some dilapidated barns on the opposite side of the road. The cottages were built around 1899 and provided housing for the men who worked at the nearby former sawmill. However, it was the old barns to which I was quickly drawn to their subject as something I like to photograph. My friend, Giles laughs at this passion (some would say obsession) with old semi-derelict and abandoned buildings. I find a beauty in their decay and decline, often paying particular attention to rusty fixtures, tatty doors and scenes of past occupation and use. I think, I may have gained a slight follower of this interest in Charles over the course of our walks. Perhaps, there is something of a lament about the passage of time. I am fascinated by the stark, brutal and often colourful processes of decay acting on old buildings. How Nature and the elements gradually consume and reclaim these testaments to labour and lost purpose. I like the spreading growth of mosses and ferns in their dense form lining the surfaces or pocketed in the gaps of crumbling stone walling. The barns certainly had a profusion of grasses, plantains and brambles and other colonizers, taking root at their base and lichen inch deep, formed on the grooves of the rusting corrugated iron roofs. The timber window frames and doors, rotting, splitting and peeling.</p>
                <p>As we walked past the cottages on one side and barns on the other, we came across a footpath that led to a weir holding back the black waters of the river. A leat is still evident and at some point, would have been used to power the former sawmill. It is currently run by a volunteer group and retains the original machinery. Close by is the narrow bridge over the Barle, with that date of 1879 on its parapet and the one that replaced an earlier one dating from Boevey's tenure in 1652. If you cross this bridge, you follow the southerly rise of Drybridge Coombe and another of the Knight roads, this one leading to South Molton. I have cycled and driven over this hill on occasions and wondered at the significance of the cairn that occupies this promontory. It stands as a memorial to <b>Sir John William Fortescue (1859-1933)</b>, whose Father, Hugh had earlier taken over the Knight estate in 1879. In doing so, he added it to the familial collection of other estates around the country and with a keen eye to the stag hunting opportunities the land offered. Indeed, Hugh Fortescue was Master and later Chairman of The Devon and Somerset Staghounds and jointly set up with other landowners, The Badgworthy Land Company. This effectively secured the rights in perpetuity for the hunting to have pretty much free rein over large swathes of the moor. His son, John, is best known for his role as Royal Librarian and Archivist at Windsor Castle. In his tenure he single-handedly produced no less than sixteen volumes of The British Army. Not content with this, he wrote a book, entitled “My native Devon “(1925), which described his love of walking the North Devon landscape from the family estate at Castle Hill, near Filleigh and his interests in country life, nature and of course, hunting. His other book, “The story of the red deer“, was admired by Henry Williamson, who wrote to Fortescue asking if he would write a forward to his forthcoming book, Tarka the Otter, to which which Fortescue ageed. In 1914 he married <b>Winifred Beech (1899-1951)</b>, some 28 years younger than him and according to a biography, diagnosed by her family GP as suffering from “intellectual starvation" at the age of 16 years, having been home taught. She was accordingly sent to Old Cedar House School in Slough and there presumably flourished in the company of other pupils. It served her well. She went on to study Acting and treaded the boards in Theatre company. A rather nice portrait exists of this time with her posing with a doll and a book, the dolls hand placed over her mouth as if in defiance refusing to allow her to speak. On marriage, Winifred gave up her acting career and set herself up in the business of interior and dress design. Photographs of the couple show them in smiling and in good natty form, he in formal plus fours and pipe stealthily navigating the rock pools of the Devon coast and she in later years, back from fleeing France, from the advance of The German invasion in 1940. Her health had been poor (one of the reasons for the couple moving to Provence in the early 1930's) and she had turned to writing as an outlet for her work. On the death of her Husband in Cannes, she had continued to live alone; the couple having had no children. After the war, Winifred returned to Provence until her death. She encouraged her late Husband's Family to erect the cairn memorial on <b>Drybridge Combe</b> and there it remains to this day. It has required the hand of intervention from The Exmoor Park Authorities in 2001 to prevent it from collapsing.</p>
                <p>In 1927, the Fortescue family sold off a portion of the estate and the bulk of the remaining estate in 1959, with the death of the Parents of <b>Lady Margaret Fortescue (1923-2014)</b>. Whilst she retained the extensive estates of Castle Hill, Filleigh, on advice (something she came to regret) she sold off much of the remaining Simonsbath estate. This included five farms and their tied cottages, such as those of West Cottages. In addition, there were farms and cottages at Kentisbury and at Challacombe not only farms and cottages, but also the village inn, hall and school. Lady Fortescue retained what she called the heart of Exmoor; <b>Simonsbath Barton</b> and it was here and on land at Cornham that she built up two herds of cattle and a flock of sheep until 1989. There is a small brass plaque to her memory at St Luke's, the local church, bearing the pleasing epitaph, “Remembered with a smile “. I discovered from Carol Woods, an émigré from the hamlet who now runs <b>The Farmer's Den</b> in nearby Exford, that the locals refer to Simonsbath as Symonsbath although this is not what they put on their address if they want to receive mail. Among her shelves and aisles of horse-riding attire, saddles and other country sport requirements was a stack of books from which I extracted a few publications of <b>The Exmoor Society</b>. It appears that in the late 1950's there was a strong opposition to plans for The Forestry Commission to acquire land from The Fortescue Estate and plant up to 1,200 acres of conifers on The Chains. The campaign proved successful and in 1957 at a tea party at his home at Simonsbath Lodge, John Coleman- Cooke announced his intention to set up The Exmoor Society as a branch of The Council for the protection of rural England (17). In the churchyard of St Luke’s, I came across the interesting gravestone of John Coleman- Cooke (1913-1978). On the front is a large stone carving of a black goose displayed and his interest as an Ornithologist. At the back of the gravestone is a tribute to his attempt to sustain the Black Grouse on the moor, by rearing them as chicks from Scotland. His gravestone also cites his founding of The Exmoor Society which has done much to encourage our knowledge of the moor. The publications and its excellent website appear to retain its primary purpose as a watchdog on the various demands on the finite landscape from farming, forestry, housing and tourism all of which need to be reconciled within the spirit of the National Park.</p>
                <p>In their own small way, the derelict appearance of the barns opposite West Cottages bore witness to an important part of the legacy of the Knight Family. In John Knight's desire to cultivate the land, he spent a considerable fortune trying to improve the land. Brush was first burnt, lime imported and the land ploughed and drained. On the lower lying and less exposed parts of the estate, there was some success in the cultivation of grain. However, it was not profitable, nor sustained or suitable for the conditions. In part, this was due to the lack of windbreaks across the estate, something introduced later, by his son, Frederic with the support of a farming consultant, Robert Smith. Many of these beech hedges, planted with bagsful of Beechnuts survive to this day. By 1840, John Knight's health began to decline and in 1842, he retired to Rome, where he died eight years later. His Son, Frederic, took over the running of the estate, continuing some of the projects already set out by his Father, but importantly finding some more sustainable ideas. He had built a number of substantial farms around the estate and as an inducement offered these at a low rate. This attracted farm tenants prepared to endure the harsh conditions and labour required. The heavy demands placed on these early farmers caused them to fail. I was mindful of this, as we walked in the direction of <b>Cornham Farm</b>. From the road, you can't see the farm, hidden by a steep redoubt of dry-stone walling and thick beech hedging, it lies midway of a track leading down the valley in the direction of the Barle. It was here on the 25th, March, 1845, that William Hannam, took on the tenancy and the challenge of the farm. Hannam wrote an account of his twelve years on Exmoor, trying unsuccessfully and often tragically to make a life for himself and his Wife, Elizabeth and their baby Daughter Emma. Theirs was a relentless struggle with the elements, precarious finances and inability to cultivate the moorland, despite every effort to improve it. Illness in the form of typhus took its toll on his health and that of his wife. His cattle suffered too and their loss only compounded the farms growing troubles, leaving the couple facing increasing debts and in despair. In the midst of eventual ruination, Hannam rode out towards Little Cornham and took a look at the farm over which, he had laboured so hard. "A feeling came over mee I must confess I shed maney tears". In the end he lost the farm and much more. The strain on Elizabeth had proved too much and she left Hannam taking their two daughters and son with her (7). Against the set-backs of failed farms with their attendant tragedies, Frederic Knight endeavoured to adapt new farming methods and practice to the estate. The improvements made to lower-lying land allowed for the cultivation of root fodder and grasses for flocks of Sheep in Winter. It was also the introduction of Blackface and Cheviot sheep brought down from the Scottish Highlands in 1866 that proved a successful initiative, paving the way for a more sustained way of farming that continues to the present day.</p>

                <p>Some measure of the growing success of the estate, were the 281 people living and working on the land by 1852 and 30 children attending the village school. By 1866, the population had almost doubled. Part of the condition of the original sale of the land, had been the reservation of 12 acres of land, for a church, burial site and vicarage. It appears from the excellent church guide, that Frederic Knight had not keen to establish the church in the village, because this would have added a further cost to his tenant farmers at a time, when the estate was struggling to establish itself. However, he came across growing calls to remedy this and work was commenced in 1855 and completed a year later. On the occasion, I visited <b>St Luke's Church</b>, the weather was very fine indeed and made for an interesting walk around the churchyard. There is a large memorial gravestone at the front of the church. It commemorates the tragic loss of Frederic and Maria Knight's only son, Frederic Sebright Winn, at the tender age of twenty-eight in 1879. In the wake of his death, his parents, Frederick and Maria decided to sell up the estate to the Fortescue Family and retired to Bath. Upon his death in 1897, the body of Frederick Knight was returned to Simonsbath to be buried in his son's grave. Inside the church, I found an array of old fading photographs, which gave some indication as to the importance of the church in the life of the community. In such an isolated community, the church would have been a necessary support for people, offering companionship and succour in the harsh conditions. One photograph showed the congregation fully assembled in the Sunday Bests, standing in the field between the church and the vicarage. I imagine they may have all trooped through the small gate at the side of the churchyard, usually reserved for the vicar. Perhaps on this occasion marking in October 1906, the centenary for the opening of the church, they had concluded a service and were now making their way down to the vicarage. I counted well over one-hundred people, including several clerics. The boys stood by the brook, which still passes below the front of the church and through the vicarage garden, where it is channelled over a waterfall and then under a small bridge and onto its meeting with Ashcombe.</p>

                <p>Our walk was, by now coming to an end. The beech trees growing tall and over-arching on both sides of the road created a darkening, corridor. Even in the wintry months, when leaves are shed, this dense skeletal frame is capable of casting shade and capturing much of the moisture in this grip. The roots and former layering create a tangled web of silvery grey tendrils that further bind the stones to the sides and create a marvellous mosaic effect. A little further on, past the boundaries of the farm, the road opened up and we were walking through a more exposed landscape. For both of us the walk back to the car was tiring. The gathering wind along this comparatively straight stretch of road, blew directly in our path and combined with a growing sense of foot weariness. I was glad to see Charles' van come into view as we rounded the last corner. Surprisingly any tiredness began to dissipate, the closer I got to the van. The walk had served us well. I had enjoyed the walk and managed it fairly easily. Most importantly, for the prospect of further walks with Charles, I had found in him a good walking companion and friend. This has proved not only to be the legacy of this walk, but subsequent river walks we have done. Long may they continue.</p>
