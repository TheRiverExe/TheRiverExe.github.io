                <p>A few miles from Exford lies the village of <b>Withypool</b> situated on the banks of the River Barle and although not technically part of this walk, a place that I had in mind, when travelling up for these northerly walks. It stemmed from conversations I’d had with a couple of friends. The first was John Woolner, who had completed a walk from Dawlish Warren to Exe Head. He'd written about it too. An article for a local publication and as we were comparing notes, he mentioned a visit to Withypool and coming across a small plaque memorial to Hope Bourne. The second encounter was with my friend, Mark Rattenbury. I was telling him about the Exe Walk and mentioned Hope Bourne as someone I was interested in finding out a little more about. Within minutes, Mark had disappeared into some corner of his house and returning to the sitting room, presented me with a copy of a book, “Reflections. Life portraits of Exmoor “(25). It was written by Birdie Johnson and complimented by Mark's superb black and white photographs.  Mark had been commissioned to photograph the residents of Exmoor who had taken part in the project run by The Dulverton and District Civic Society. It is an impressive piece of work, recording both a written and oral account of the lives of the people interviewed for the book. Not all the people, who agreed to take part in this archive project, were willing to be photographed. So, Mark was given a list of those, who had agreed and made arrangements to travel around Exmoor, to meet and make portraits of the subjects. It was now, many years ago since this commission, but I was impressed by how vividly, Mark retained strong memories and affection for those he had met. I liked the interest and pride, he took in some of his favoured photographs, capturing in a moment, the essential character of the person and their story.</p>
                <p>I confess, that having spoken to both John and Mark, inspired me, to pursue the book, even if I felt a little daunted by their polished accomplishments. To their eternal credit, both were (and are) very supportive of the project, but any pretensions on my part, to being the next Bill Bryson, have long been brought to heel. In some ways, I have come to the view that I am following in the larger footsteps of many others, adding, but adding, rather than subtracting to the sum of what we know. In this respect, I am grateful to Mark for the gift of his book, which is on my desk, as I write this piece; open to the small biography and photograph of Hope Bourne. She is standing on the farm track that leads down to the disused <b>Ferny Ball Farm</b> and the site where she lived in a caravan, for many years, until in 1994, when poor health and persuasion by her many friends, resulted in her move to a housing scheme in Withypool some four miles from Ferny Ball.</p>

                <p>Mark recalled that Hope had asked to meet him at <b>Landacre Bridge</b> rather than at her home and their encounter had wound up half-way down the track that led to her former settlement. I noted that Birdie Johnson, had interviewed Hope "in the shade of a hedge and looking across to Ferny Ball". It seems as if Hope allowed very few into her former solitary domain at the farm. I also wondered, if she had walked to the bridge from her home in Withypool for the interviews. It would have meant re-tracing the route she made regularly between Ferny Ball and Withypool in former days. Landacre Bridge meant a great deal to Hope and she wrote about it with a fond proprietorial air writing of the bridge that “I have loved you, ever since I first saw you, many, many years ago“ and “the nooks of rock, I regard as my very own, just below the bend of the river“(26) In the photograph, Hope is standing resolutely on the track, her right hand clutching a roughly fashioned branch used as a walking stick. In the distance, is sight of one of the barns just visible through a gap in the hedge and tall trees that surround the farm to which she would return alone. There is no eye contact with the photographer, instead they are averted to the distance; perhaps momentarily recalling a store of memories evoked in the valley. If there is an awkwardness, it is suggestive of a shy private person, but she manages a pleasant and perhaps polite smile for the camera. There is nonetheless, a strength and purpose in her up-right appearance. Her words certainly conveyed this in an interview she gave, that there was a need to be "100 per cent physically fit to live as I do. You've got to be tough, body and soul. Whatever happens at Ferny Ball, I've got to cope with it alone." I have little doubt that she was mentally tough too and a glimpse of this is expressed in her smile accentuating the deep lines on her weathered face.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Hope Bourne, in her late thirties, found herself effectively homeless, after her widowed Mother with whom she had lived, passed away and the house sold to clear debts. Hope now had to make a new life for herself and chose to strike out for Exmoor. She began by living in primitive cottages and writing about her experiences based in part on her journals recording the wildlife, landscape, people, customs and life to be found in the area around Withypool. She wrote exceedingly well. Her first book; “Living on Exmoor” (1963) paved the way for four more books chronicling and illustrating in pen and ink drawings, the Exmoor landscape over which she lived and roamed. What might have been her last book, “My Moorland Years” (1993), was superseded with the discovery of a manuscript entitled “village surveys” and posthumously published under the title” Hope Bourne’s Exmoor Village” (2014). The book provides a wonderful glimpse into the village and the surrounding landscape that Hope had very much adopted. It also revealed that in her late 40's and early 50's, Hope experienced heartbreak in an unrequited love and for a period suffered what she described as “a complete breakdown due to some very great personal unhappiness “. For a period, she travelled to the Shetlands, Australia and Canada, but by the late 1960's, she had rallied and at the time of writing the manuscript was living in a small cottage in Withypool, overlooking “the hill “, a name she used to describe Withypool Hill. It was during this period, that she wrote about a visit she had made to the” cosy farmhouse”, at <b>Ferny Ball Farm</b>, near to Sherdon Hutch and a place where some friends lived at the time. A little while later, an accident with an oil heater caused the farmhouse to be burnt to the ground. The farm was sold and the shell of the house, eventually covered to serve as a storage space. It remains so to this day, but it was to this place that she later moved in the early 1970's, into a caravan situated on the grounds of the former farm. There she lived by five basic rules that she stated would keep you alive. These were the necessity of fresh water, food; a roof over your head; a fire and lastly protective clothing. She might have added a sixth necessity in the form of two rifles she bought to hunt for food. Hers was a largely self-sufficient lifestyle; living alone and managing on a frugal existence with a budget of one pound a day from which she bought matches, paraffin and her single luxury; chocolate. She was certainly kept busy. She grew vegetables, fruit and other produce; kept chickens, fished and hunted. Her abiding passion was roaming the moorland and making notes and drawings. In her lifetime and beyond, she achieved popularity for her writing and choice of lifestyle. Hope attracted wide coverage as the subject of television documentaries, articles and books, acquiring the title, “Lady of Exmoor”.</p>

                <p>And it was her story, that inspired me to visit to Ferny Ball Farm and Withypool, co-inciding with a lull in our walks. The day chosen, was windy and wet and these elements greeted me as soon as I stepped out of my car at <b>Landacre Gate</b>. I left the relative comfort of the car and made my way down the road in the direction of Landacre Bridge. I was in search of the track that would take me down to <b>Sherdon Rock</b> and onto Ferny Ball Farm. The rain was fine and persistent, however, wrapped in my waterproofs, I felt snug and dry and filled with a sense of eager anticipation, as to what I might find at Ferny Ball, assuming I could find it. For company, there were only a few rather bedraggled cows grazing, who occasionally looked in my direction. Otherwise, I felt completely alone and thoroughly enjoyed this sense of solitude. I wondered how I might cope if this state became suddenly permanent or prolonged.  I came to conclusion that I would struggle, not least because I would miss those close and dear to me. Hope, wrote that, people often asked her if she felt lonely on the moors. She soon corrected them, stating she was in fact very well connected to local inhabitants, was kept fully occupied and also felt in the wider company of the landscape and “other forms of company than that of human kind “(27). About half way down the hill, I turned off the road in the direction of what I hoped would lead to Ferny Ball Farm. The weather reminded me of a passage from her last book, Moorland Farm, in which she described the kind of day I was experiencing; "A wet day on the moor. Wet black heather, squelchy black peat, soaking brown-dew rush, no colour but sodden brown-red fern"(28). Further along the track my sense of solitude was temporarily interrupted by a few travellers’ vans making their slow passage up towards the main road having spent their night stop amongst the grassy enclaves of a former mining spoil at Kingsland Pits. They waved as they passed and I noted, pleasingly that no litter had been left. Below to my right, I could see Sherdon Hutch and The River Barle, but the track now wound around the valley in the direction of <b>Sherdon Waters</b> and the rise of <b>Great Sherdon Ball</b>. I stopped to check of my map and confirmed that somewhere in that mass of trees was the place I was seeking. </p>

                <p>Following the track down to the stream and crossing a moss laden bridge, I negotiated a farm gate and followed a rough track. Buildings gradually came into view behind the screens of trees and the eager sense of exploration, now gave way to a slight sense of apprehension. I became uneasy, aware that at any moment, some fired up individual could emerge with righteous outrage. I would have no excuse, but to state my interest in visiting this place and hoping this might earn me some reprieve. Fortunately, there was no need for me to worry. For an hour or two, I explored the abandoned farm searching for remnants of Hope’s past occupation. The caravan that was her home for many years had been ferried into the side of the former farmhouse. I could see very little, through the dusty windows and pulled curtains of the caravan. I had to content myself with the memory of an interview she did with Daniel Farson, for Alone on Exmoor (1977), conducted inside the cramped space of the caravan. Surrounded by her worldly goods, I could do no better, than quote from her book, Wild Harvest (27) to get an evocation of this space. “Home! I sit in all cosy and secure in my own little home this winter's night, with my writing-paper on my knee, my bright fire lighting its pages for me to write with my familiar paper “. Around her are the items of daily living, much treasured and vital in her daily life. Her stove, “singing kettle “, teapot, iron frying pan, saucepan. Outside, I wandered about the sheds and surrounding pockets of land and found the remains of buckets, plant pots and broken implements, that must have been in her service all those years ago. I came across the discovery of mouldy National Geographic’s, encyclopaedias and copies of Field magazine lying rotting in boxes and bags. These were once, the “papers and magazines, old in date but fresh in interest pile along the back of my bunk for bedtime reading “. These were the now decaying relics of the things she had read, handled and saved during her years of hard and frugal living at Ferny Ball. I felt moved by the sight of these everyday objects gradually yielding to degradation by the elements. On one of the dusty shelves, I came across the object that had the most resonance. Hope wrote about the dresser-end where “the small oil-lamp glows, lighting my room and touching all my treasures as in Aladdin’s cave, and beside it sits my precious wireless set which brings all the word to me “. The object, I found was the glass funnel of the lamp and next to it, a wooden lid of a box with the label “Roberns. Fruit from Australia”. The words of Madeline Bunting came to mind, “Our most proud and intimate house-keeping is destined to be dismembered, disintegrate and fall apart”. Love of Country. Madeleine Bunting(2016).</p>

                <br />
                <p>The small square patch of grass in front of the derelict farmhouse was used by Hope as the pitch for her caravan. Around the perimeter of the grass were shrubs and trees which I imagine formed part of her beloved garden “for me, the most precious thing in the world, next after a home itself, is a garden “. I conjure up an image of Hope, in her “hill country garden “, setting about the garden in much the same way and passion, as I recall my Maternal Grandmother, <b>Barbara Martin (1911-1997)</b>. Both had a passion for gardening and similar choices of head scarves and thick coats. They also had the proverbial green-fingers about them, in planting up impressive beds of flowers, shrubs and trees. On occasions, when I have walked around Exmouth, I can still see the legacy of my Grandmother's planting. In Halsdon Avenue, Exmouth, the lilac and forsythia still offer perfume and colour each year. I looked around the former garden, Hope sketched and created. In the wintery conditions, the weeds that proliferate the garden now, were subdued and it was possible to see the beds and plots where flowers and vegetables would have been cultivated. “This is my garden, my staff of life which gives me food to eat and the joy of flowers for delight “(27). Beyond, the garden boundary lay a sloping bank beyond. Re-tracing my steps back down the track to a small wooden gate, I entered the field behind the garden and descended the wild meadow with purple flowering thistles and thick grasses. At the bottom of the valley was a ribbon of small Oak, Hawthorn, Holly and Hazel trees, that I judged, hid the stream down to which, Hope made regular trips armed with two metal buckets. I had seen a couple of rusting buckets around the farm, and now imagined Hope carrying these (and a jug) to collect the water from the stream, when the spring wasn't yielding her more usual source of water. The stream was her “waterhole, a tint rock-pool under the rushes with the glistening rill of water splashing in and rippling out “. Hope found this a place of enchantment, but ever-practical, knew that the return trip needed care as the slope was steep and the water heavy. Freed of such concerns, I waded through the tall grasses, aware that with each step my shoes and trouser legs became more sodden. However, for all the dampness, I was neither cold nor troubled. Having immersed myself in this hidden domain, I was becoming aware, that my time here was soon to come to an end and I would regret not taking the chance to acquaint myself with the stream. Despite its diminutive size, there proved to be a sturdy little current almost skipping in places, over the array of stones, branches and rocks that defied smooth progress. The banks and verges were barely visible in the protrusion of low-lying branches and vegetation that spread across the stream. These created at random intervals a variety of half- hidden chambers and coves. There was a shallow ford fashioned by the trample of generations of hooves and feet. This led up to a gate to the right, passing into a small woodland bordered by a mossy stone wall that rose up the opposite side of the hill. I decided that I would pause here a while and savour this moment and the quietness of this place. </p>

                <Header as="h1">Wild flask drinking.</Header>
                <p>Making my way up to a slight curve in the wall, I found a smooth dry stone upon which to sit and slightly shielded from the rain by a large overhanging beech tree. Arranging myself as comfortably as possible, I reached into my ruck-sack and pulled out my flask of hot milky coffee and bar of chocolate. If there is one simple pleasure, I have enjoyed over the years, it is the sacred communion of wild flask drinking. I am reminded of this as I sit at my desk. I have a steaming cup of milky coffee to my side. It transports me back to this rainy day at Ferny Ball and for that matter, any number of occasions, the flask has provided a warm repose. There is always something soothing, nurturing and comforting about my beloved flask. It is the gift that keeps on giving. It looks nice, is warm to the touch and on opening the screw cap, there is that familiar inviting smell of hot milky coffee. Pouring myself a cup, I savour the steam and smell of the sweet coffee. Sometimes, I am content just to hold the cup of coffee in both hands, to feel its warmth and bury my face close to the rim of the cup. I can report that I did just these things, as indeed, I have done in the composing of these words. It is a nice thing to do. Close to the stream, I drained the last drop of coffee from the cup and leaned back against the wall. I listened attentively to the sound of running water. First of all, there was a familiarity with its sound resonating with that I have heard on many stretches of streams over the years. The performance is unending and anarchic. I suppose, it merges with a soundtrack of the Devon, that has formed over years. It comprises an orchestra of sounds, ranging from the rustle of autumnal dry leaves, the call of the wood pigeon and rustling sound of the waves breaking on the pebbles along Budleigh beach.</p>

                <p className="quote-credit">Rambles in Somerset (1912).</p>
                <p>I began the journey back up towards the farm and on reaching the gate caught a glimpse in the distance, of the bend in the approach track, where Mark had taken the photograph of Hope all those years ago. It marked an invisible border crossing between this private domain and the wider world beyond. Along this track, or the Barle, Hope would walk to Withypool, to do her weekly shopping and errands. A film by Chris Chapman recorded in 1994, showed Hope at the point, where she had moved to a rented house in Withypool. The clippage showed her paying by cheque for her shopping in the village post office and exchanging pleasantries. Having put her provisions into her rucksack, she is filmed, making her way over to the bridge overlooking The River Barle. There is a rather poignant moment, when Hope is filmed, leaning over the bridge in quiet contemplation reflecting on the “many years now Withypool under the long shadows of the moors “had been her home. By this stage in her life, she no longer faced the two mile walk back to her beloved Ferny Ball, something borne witness to in the earlier documentary "Alone on Exmoor" made in 1977 by the writer and broadcaster, Daniel Farson. This showed a younger looking Hope, on her weekly Friday visit to the post office to Withypool. It shows her 4-mile round trip made on foot to collect her post and from her shopping list, choose a loaf of bread and box of matches and bar of chocolate. There is a lovely exchange between Mr Jeffries, the Proprietor introducing the new owner, Harry Mackenzie to Hope.</p>
                <p>I parked in a small car park close to the bridge. The weather had discouraged lots of day-trippers and I seemed to be the only visitor. Whatever primitive simplicity the Wades experienced in the village, has long since given way to quite a prosperous looking village. It was certainly quiet, when I visited, but there wasn't a feeling of solitude, more a sense of calm and things not being rushed. I rather liked that. It is a pleasant looking place and I would guess, be recognisable to Hope today, especially the post office which outwardly remains much the same. It lies in the “hub “as Hope described the triad of the post office, filling station (now closed and open as a cafe) and the bridge. This is where many of the transactions and exchanges took place at the time of Hope's tenure in the area. It may well have changed in the intervening years with the advent of technology, but it remains essentially a People Place. When I called into the post office, the owner was very welcoming and told me he had only recently taken over the business and was busily building up his stock. He had heard of Hope Bourne, but he didn't have any of her books at the present and this was something he planned to do. I bought myself, a sandwich and had a walk around the village. By now, you've probably guessed, that I would make my way to the village church of <b>St Andrews</b> and sure enough, I did go there. Having had a look around, I came across a delightful enclosed public garden next to the village hall. In spring, I imagine the blossom from the cherry trees must be a welcome sight, but I was glad of some late afternoon sunshine warming the covered bench area and the fine view up towards Withypool Hill. Hope had written about this “pretty little patch, entered by a wicker-gate and laid out as a memorial to one Claire Norton, killed in a car accident “. The garden was donated to the village by her grieving parents; a fine public-spirited tribute. Alas, <b>The Royal Oak</b>, was closed, otherwise, I might have popped in. There, I could have contemplated some pedigree in the stakes of pub heritage. R.D Blackmore, sitting in one of the snugs, penning part of Lorna Doone; the artist Alfred Munnings, in his loft, or coming for a drink from his former house “The Palace “in the village. The landlord, at one time was reputedly, the inspiration for the character, M, in Ian Fleming's James Bond. On my way back towards the car, I stopped off in the tea room, close to the river. I sat comfortably in that state of happy anonymity alone with my thoughts taking stock of the day. A small gathering was engaged in conversation about a school reunion and sharing updates on their holidays, families and health. The men appeared in their mid to late seventies and it struck me how valuable such long-term friendships are in reaffirming life's varied experiences and a sense of belonging. With these weighty thoughts, I settled up and made my way back towards the bridge, a place where Hope noted people frequently stood to “look for fish “(26). Leaning over the parapet, I gazed upstream at the blackish waters of the Barle in the direction, Hope must have looked many a time. She certainly wrote about the view of the trees and the withies on the bank, that she speculated, gave rise to the name of the village. “I like to think it so “, she wrote. It is this water, that has provided the abundance for the four harvests invested in the valley. The turf, being the first; the second, the whortleberries and the hay and corn, the third and fourth. Then turning, I walked up Worth Lane and to the village sign. From here, the road makes its way onto the open moorland and the rise of Withypool Hill. I turned around and made my way back towards my car. It had been a glorious day.</p>

                <p>The following year, I returned to the hills overlooking The River Barle and its confluence with <b>Sherdon Waters</b> and Cow Castle Hill. If anything, the weather was too hot. The run of bone-dry days had turned much of the country into one vast roasting pan. Exmoor had not escaped; its natural sponge had become firm to foot and in such an open landscape there seemed little place to escape the heat. The grassy banks and lowered waters of the Barle around Landacre Bridge was like an oasis offering the chance to cool down. It was alive with the sights and sounds of families paddling in the water and generally seeking some kind of respite from the hot weather. For our part, Kathy and I made our way past this delightful setting in the direction of Sherdon Hutch. I had a date with a swimming spot, mentioned not only in my much-thumbed Wild Swimmers Book, but also from memory of my first walk along this stretch. As I made my way to Ferny Ball Farm, I had I spied the potential for a swim at the meeting of the Barle with Sherdon Waters. Now, that I was there, standing on the baked earthen bank over-looking the shallow clear pool below, I felt a little mournful. At best, it appeared little more than a paddling pool. It was certainly not the place, I had conjured in my mind and barely deep enough to assuage the heat and sweat accumulated on our path here. I resigned myself to a paddle and mini-dip at the lowest point of the river bed. Having changed into my shorts, I waded through the water, navigating the stones and pebbles below and made my way to the shallows, where the Barle and Sherdon Waters met. The collision of these two waters was noticeably weak and I found a relatively smooth patch on the river bed to sit and feel its current. It was rather like taking the pulse of the river. Before long, there was a tickling sensation around my feet and legs. Looking down, I noticed small fledgling brown Exmoor Trout nibbling away. Just as I was trying to work out if the experience was troubling, or rather fun, my attention was suddenly drawn to a voice. It came from a man crossing the pool and making his way under a fence into a small pocket of wood. He must have seen my disappointment with the lack of swimming potential. "There's better swimming to be had up there", he helpfully told me, indicating the direction he was going. I could hear other people splashing about up-river and not being one to miss out on a good swimming opportunity I swiftly followed. </p>
                <p>This led to the nice discovery of a much deeper, shadier pool, just the other side of a storm barrier across the Barle. These barriers are an attempt to contain the build-up of loose timber that can swiftly block up bridges further downstream at times of flood. Well, flooding today was unlikely, but the prospect of a cooling swim now seemed very much on the cards. I found a likely entry spot and having conducted my NUTS Analysis, decided all the conditions made a swim imperative. With a complete lack of finesse, I lowered myself into the water and my feet quickly lost touch with the river bed. I was almost immediately joyously afloat in the river. I lost no time, in diving down into the deep murkiness below and tried to stay submerged as long as I could. I wanted to be freed from the savage heat of the day, even if this meant a few seconds. Slowly, I felt a luscious coolness envelop me. It was entirely pleasing and welcome. I wanted to make a mental store up this coolness, knowing that as soon as I left this little oasis, I would once again, face the heat of the afternoon. I made one last attempt to completely immerse myself in the deep pool and exhaling air, made a drop to the bottom of the river bed. My feet danced on the riverbed, as I tried to stay down for as long as possible. I emerged from the depths of the pool, into the dappled light and cool shade of the surrounding woodland. On the bank, my earlier guide was standing with two of his sons. They were taking it in turns to plunge into the water. As the boys resurfaced, they made their way downstream, leaving me the room of the pool to wallow in at my own leisure. I fell into conversation with the man who had kindly directed me to this little haven. His name was Sam and he was very familiar with the area, having grown up in nearby Porlock. Sam was one of nine children and born into a poor fishing family in the seaside towm. At an early age, Sam's outdoor pursuits were as much about helping the family to make ends meet, as recreation. Whatever, difficulties, Sam faced in childhood, he appears to have done well in later life. He now runs his own software company and lives in London with his family, but has a second home in Martinhoe, not far from Woody Bay, one of the nicest North Devon swimming sites. He had a lot to say about Exmoor and The Exmoor National Park, in particular, suggesting that they were in league with the sheep farmers, at the expense of change that might help the wider community. I listened without making any useful comment. Even if I had any position to debate this, it didn't seem the right place or moment. As I bobbed up and down the water, Sam cited a number of complaints about the difficulties of building affordable housing, obtaining planning and building permission, the need for the moorland to be re-wildered and forestry and farming be more actively encouraged to develop the local economy. To be honest, I can't recall exactly how we concluded this little encounter. Maybe having said his piece, Sam felt he had given some expression to the passion he clearly feels for this beautiful part of the world. In this respect, he was in good company. Hope Bourne was equally passionate about the challenges facing the Exmoor landscape, wildlife and its communities. Interestingly, she was one of the firstsignatures on a 1958 petition to stop the afforestation of the Chains (26). Sam was summoned by his boys and I made my way towards the bank and clamboured out. It had been a good swim. Sam's opinions remind me of the passions that frequently arise out of disputes over land use and there being nothing new about this. We have been arguing about this for thousands of years and the next place, Kathy and I, had planned to visit, provided an example of this further upstream.</p>

                <p>There was barely any need to dry myself by the time, I got back to where Kathy was seated. In no time, we were ready to walk along the Barle in the direction of Cow Castle Settlement. To get there, we made our way along Two Moors Way in the direction of Picked Stones, which made for a very pleasant walk. In the past the presence of mining works in the valley and the transport of men and material along the track we were following would have presented a very different appearance. The noise, smoke and workings have long since disappeared or consumed into the landscape. It is an altogether more rustic and tranquil setting, although recent logging had scythed trees off the hillsides revealing the sparse stumps and bleached grasses. Along the valley floor ran the Barle, its current much reduced in the prolonged drough. On a couple of occasions, we sought shelter from the fierce sunshine in the shade of a small wooded dell by the side of the river. Within a short space of time, the rise of Cow Castle came into view, an Iron Age monument, its exact purpose is not known. It could have served as some kind of defensive position or haven for cattle and may well have arisen out of disputes over land use with the increase in population in the area. The less received wisdom is that may have an even older mystical origin with fairies building it to protect themselves. If there were any fairies hiding in the undergrowth, we didn't see them. Kathy was more concerned with the prospect of cows in the area. What with fairies under attack, the threat of rampaging cows, I also learn that the hill top, itself, is under threat. It is in danger of being engulfed by bracken which swamps its features and obscures its outline from the surrounding valleys. In the event, any fairies or grazing cows were taking relief from the shade offered from the woodier part of the river. The heat of the day was merciless and by now, having reached the foothill of Cow Castle, we were growing tired. We decided not to climb it and decided to turn back for a last paddle in the Sherdon Hutch pool before making our way home. As we walked away, I said a farewell to the memory of Hope Bourne.</p>

                <br />
                <p>The story of Hope Bourne put me in mind of two women whose stories and prominence arose out the moorlands they occupied and whose experiences had some loose parallel with Hope. If Hope was known as The Lady of the Exmoor, then <b>Olive Katherine Parr (1874-1955)</b> or her writing pseudonym of Beatrice Chase, acquired the title as 'The Lady of the Moor'. The moor in this case was Dartmoor, a place to which she and her Mother had moved at the turn of the last century. Initially, they had recuperation in mind but finally settling at <b>Higher Venton Farm</b>, near Widecombe in the Moor, as a permanent home. Olive, like Hope, began to write, only her books took the form of novels and borrowed much from the landscape of the moors (particularly The River Dart) as to the caricatures of the community in which she lived. Her first novel "The Heart of the Moor" was successful and her subsequent books were popular too. Visitors would call at her home in the hope of meeting her and purchasing her books (29). Amongst the many visitors she received was John Oxenham, an author of poetry, hymns and ecleastical incantations, congregational church leader, co-founder of The Idler Magazine and later Mayor of Worthing, Surrey. His novel “My Lady of the Moor” (30) provides a semi-fictionalised account of meeting Olive in the chapel she had built on the farm. The introduction to the book provides a flavour of his esteem for her using her pen name: “To Beatrice. My lady of the moor who by her noble faith and many prayers saved alive the soul of one sinful man and it pleases God of two. “It seems Olive rather took to the title of Lady of the Moor, perhaps because she relished her loose association with Henry VIII’s last Wife. She is recalled as playing “the part to her Oxenham novel. As the lady of the moor, she frequently accosted visitors on the moors, welcoming them with a sprig of white heather, when in season and more or less graciously conferring upon them the freedom of the moor “(10). She is, nonetheless, credited with her support for the moors. In the 1930’s she helped revive the tradition of The Widecombe Fair by requesting the BBC to play the tune associated with the event on the day it took place. In her book, The Heart of the moor, Olive also helped popularise, Jay’s Grave, close to Hounds Tor. This is a well-known visitors spot on Dartmoor and reputedly, where a young woman who took her life, is buried. A tradition has long been established of leaving fresh flowers and Olive’s remarks on this,” going nearer I found that unknown hands had placed upon it a rough cross of ducky flowers, which lay limp in the sunshine” (31). For many years, Olive would lay flowers on the grave. Together with Oxenham, she established The White Knight Crusade during The First World War to protect the moral values of servicemen at war and it may be a co-incidence that she supposedly lost an un-named and uncorroborated fiancé during this conflict.</p>

                <p>The loss of her Mother in the early 1920’s, marked a significant loss in Olive’s life at Venton and she became increasingly at odds with people and more withdrawn. In 1929, she was forced to issue an apology for a libel she made against the Abbot of Buckfast Abbey and was subsequently excommunicated. A year later, she alleged that two male nurses had driven down from London to await a medical doctor with a view to detaining her to a private psychiatric hospital. In the event the doctor didn’t materialise and nothing more came of this, but it lends to the impression that things were not going so well for her. She continued to write with a routine, that included early morning waking, cold baths and long tramps across the moors. However, the loss of her friend John Oxenham in 1941, also co-incided with the declining popularity of her books and her financial circumstances becoming much tighter. Olive took to renting out the farmland and the farm, to make ends meet and was increasingly reliant on the help of two long-term retainers. Her final years were tragically marred by a marked deterioration in her mental health; more embittered, capricious moods and prone to paranoia and hostility. She had taken to keeping a loaded handgun beside her bed and this added to the growing concern for her welfare and that of others. In the early hours of an October morning 1954, several Policemen attended the medical doctor to determine if hospital admission was necessary. One report is that she brandished the gun and threatened to shoot (7) but in the event, was disarmed and taken at the age of 80-years in a straight-jacket to The North Devon Infirmary in Barnstaple. She was kept there until the following year, returning to the farm in November 1954, but entering into a terminal decline with cancer and ending her days in Newton Abbot Infirmary. Her gravestone lies close to that of her Mothers in churchyard of St Pancras (“The Cathedral of The Moor”) in Widecombe in the Moor.</p>

                <Header as="h1">Higher Venton Farm</Header>
                <p>There is a nice circular walk from the churchyard at St Pancras, leading you along a landscape that has changed little since Olive’s time. Leaving the churchyard and stepping into The Square, ahead the focal point of the Yew Tree buttressed by a granite wall comes into view. On a hot sunny day, it is a good shady place to sit and look upon <b>The Old Inn</b>, where Olive and her Mother originally stayed. A signpost helpfully points in the direction of Higher Venton Farm, harking back to the hey days of Olive’s writing career when many visitors came, as a pilgrimage, to The Lady of the moor and her books. They too, may well have followed the sign, leaving the cluster of cottages that are soon passed on the descent of a narrow lane, banked either side with sturdy granite dry-stone walls. <b>The Rugglestone Inn</b> presumably benefitted from this passing trade and it is a hugely popular destination with day-trippers and devotees of its Dartmoor charm and beer. On the day, Kathy, Barney and I passed, walked by, we enjoyed the sight of a busy beer garden full of eager families perking their heads up anticipatingly, whenever food was being brought out. The first sight of Higher Venton Farm came into view, framed by the tall hedges either side of the lane and upon closer inspection, it is a substantial farmhouse. Olive and her Mother originally intended to rent one of the small cottages on the farm, but when the farm and the land came up for sale, they managed to acquire the whole estate (29). Over time, they had an extension built to the farmhouse and this is where I called, in the hope of having a look at the chapel. In Simon Dell’s book, he has a forward by Peter Hicks, who continues to live in the extension where Olive and her Mother had lived for the greater part of their time on the moors. Alas, Peter was unable to see me when I called at the house and his Wife, Elizabeth regretted that she wasn’t able to show me around the chapel, which is closed up, but the stained-glass windows were visible. We also had the chance to see the terrace of the four farm labourers’ cottages and the back of the extension with south-westerly window of The Room of sunshine, where Olive’s Mother “The Rainbow Maker” would work on creating glass beads.</p>

                <p>My other interest, was to see if I could discover the site of the swimming pool Olive had commissioned. Again, turning to Simon Dell’s book there was mention of this being located close to <b>Dunstone Bridge</b> and a fine photograph of Olive climbing up a wooden ladder from the pool in her bathing apparel, including a bathing hat. Even if we hadn’t found it, the walk would have taken us past some delightful country lanes and through Dunstone with its ancient farm, Manor House and Preaching Cross. As it was, I located it with the help of a fencing contractor, who pointed to the spot known still locally as “the swimming pool”. The former pool is now fenced off and filled with years’ worth of accumulated mud and covered with all manner of vegetation. We found a way into the pool from the bridge end and aided by the recent dry summer, found it possible to walk and stand on the dried sediment and plants that have amassed to fill the pool now. A stream that at one time, would have fed the pool has now been diverted and all that remains is the concrete wall and a set of stairs. I felt slightly disappointed that there was no way of immersing myself in this squelchy mire, but was fortunate that a generous stretch of <b>East Webburn River</b> flowed close to where we were standing. So, opening up a gate downstream of the bridge, we found a bank close to the river and illuminated in the late afternoon sunshine. Changing into my shorts, I waded into the far side of the river where the water appeared at least knee deep. Then kneeling down, attempted rather unceremoniously to launch myself under the water to get at the very least a full immersion. It reminded me of the many small dunking’s I’ve managed on Dartmoor in the small streams that have lured me on hot sunny days. The proper swims, where open water has allowed, has been no more memorable to these little moments where shallower water has flowed over me and I felt its shield against the heat. Sitting on the pebbly river bed and finding my balance, I had a look about me. Turning myself in the direction of the earthen bank in front of me I could make out <b>Pil Tor</b> and <b>Top Tor</b> in the distance. Smoke from a controlled fire near <b>Haytor</b> rose up behind these tors, adding a sense of danger to the landscape. And then my mind turned to the question of where the fictitious “Dream Tor” of ‘Heart of the moor’ may have lain. It was supposedly the fictional name, she gave to one of the places, Olive would visit during her rambles across the moors. “My favourite home tor. On it I have seen my sublimest visions, dreamt up divinest dreams “. On such a day as this, I could imagine Olive taking one last glance towards Ripon Tor and Haytor in the distance, before turning her attention to returning to the valley that we now had to leave. And I thanked her for bringing me to this lovely part of Dartmoor.</p>

                <p>The last of these women of the moor concerns the life of the late <b>Hannah Bayles Tallentine Hauxwell (1926- 2018)</b> who was the subject of documentary, books and a film (A winter too long). The interest sprang from a chance meeting between a group of walkers coming across Hannah on The Yorkshire Moors and clearly, she made an impression, because they suggested to Barry Cockcroft, a television programme producer, that Hannah might be someone worth meeting. In the event, he wasn't the first person to draw attention to her challenging circumstances (in 1970 she was subject to an article in The Yorkshire Post entitled "How to be happy on £170 a year") but it was their meeting and the profitable partnership that arose out of this, over two decades, that helped lift Hannah out of the desperate situation she felt trapped in. Hannah, unlike Hope and Olive was born into a farming family and one, that was trying to carve out a precarious living on the 78 acres of land that made up Low Hatt Farm, Baldersdale, by the side of Balderhead Reservoir. It became the place, Hannah had spent the lion share of her life by the time Cockcroft managed to find her. From childhood, she had grown up into a close-knit farming community with long established practices and customs which had evolved to support the community in times of hardship. Many farming families had children to support the running of their farms, but Hannah was an only child, born to sickly parents and in his early thirties, her Father died and she felt duty bound to support her widowed Mother and Uncle (who had moved in to help run the farm) and this made it more difficult for her to socialise and develop a more independent life. By the time her Mother, then Uncle had died, Hannah found herself alone. She had not married nor formed any significant relationships outside of the farm, leaving her with the full burden of running the farm. In her own words she, "had to do it all by myself". For years, she struggled to make a living out of the slim rewards from the farming. At times, she was near destitution and forced to survive the bitter winters and frequently uncomfortable summers, in rudimentary living conditions, that bore little relation to the accepted norms of running water, electricity and other household conveniences. For company, her cows and other farm animals took on a level of surrogate friends and she could spend considerable periods on her own without having anyone with whom to talk. The runaway success of the television documentaries, books and films (not to mention the wonderful photographs), provided a vivid account of her daily life and struggle to maintain her independence. Her stories were part of the oral tradition of a community now largely lost on time. There was a touching charitable response by viewers who witnessed her struggles to survive in such harsh and exacting circumstances and offers of help were swiftly forthcoming.</p>
                <p>With the fame (earning her the title of The First Lady of the Yorkshire Dales) and financial benefits she acquired, she still continued to try and maintain her life on the farm, but entering her sixties with ill-health creeping in she reflected increasingly on how long she could continue to manage alone on the farm. At the same time, she wrestled with the strong emotional attachment to the place. "Over many years (people) have tried to gently persuade me to go straight away and live the rest of my life in comfort, but you see I'm in chains to this place". However, those chains were finally broken when she accepted a cottage at the nearest town of Cotherstone. And it seems, she happily settled there with the benefits of local conveniences and utilities, not to mention the goodwill of the community. Summing up she said "I have a lot going for me. I have good friends and if I keep my faculties, if my eyes behave themselves and my hearing stays good, then I shall be content"(32).</p>
